My hopes and prayers are with all of you. This has received more attention and accomplished more than any politician.

Thank all the truckers for giving us hope.

Thank you Truckers for standing up to the corporate  from a 70 year old grandma. In all of my 70 years I have not seen such disgusting behaviour from what is supposed to be our government.

I thank God for these freedom truckers. They have helped give a voice to us that believe the same - believe in freedom of speech and freedom of choice. Government overreach must come to an end. Scientific peer-reviewed studies are pouring in from all over the globe. The narrative must change and align with current data results. And, the mandates are contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

First I was glad you were protesting the cross border vaccination mandates (I'm fully vaccinated). But now I'm glad you are standing up for free speech and freedom. We are all individuals, and it's not the government's or Trudeau's job to solve all our problems. Being vaccinated is our own choice. The real problem is our medical system, not who gets vaccinated.Keep it loving guys and you will win.

I congratulate the truckers for taking a stand.  I am fully vaccinated and I have also received my booster, but I believe the vaccine mandates are simply wrong.  As a Canadian I have carefully watched events unfold in my country, and what angered me the most was the Trudeau government's decision to politicize vaccine policy.

Liberty and Freedom are inalienable rights. They aren’t granted or given - they already “are”.

The Lord Jesus put an image in my mind of a convoy of trucks backing onto the beaches of Normandy with swarms of truckers storming pillboxes full of police officers.  Not a shot was fired.  As the truckers approached the oppressors, the police, dressed in black and geared for war, looked upon themselves, saw the folly of their loyalties, and fell upon their knees in shame.  God bless you.

Had to leave the Country due to previous gov decision to retrospectively tax my research stipend. As people affected from the measure was not such a big number our protest was absolutely ignored and unheard. Cannot express how happy I am to see somebody has the brains, balls and numbers to stand up and be heard. As I cannot be physically present, here is my contribution to kick their buts!

As a CDN lawyer I support the truckers. If you impose the will of the 90% on the 10%, it will be just like 1930's  Germany . In the end, 100% suffered equally. You can not exclude your own citizens from society, Unite and regain your freedom.

Thank you for standing up for Canadians.  Enough is enough. The politicians and bureaucrats blocked me from seeing my 96 year grandmother.. She died along. A ww2 widow! You blocked me from Crown land, from moving freely in my own country that I fought for in afghanistan.  Well, we are blocking you until you end this tyranny.   This is a wake up call.  You work for us,
