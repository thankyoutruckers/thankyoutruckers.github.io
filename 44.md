I never thought in my wildest dreams that our rights and freedoms would be rescued by truckers, but once you think about it logistically you guys can put so much pressure on the system and can't be removed easily like people can to make a difference. They will have to give us our rights and freedoms back if you guys continue. I can't be with you guys in person, so here is some money to help.

Two years of government over reach has caused more damage than this virus could ever have hoped to have achieved on its own. <br /><br />Long term damage in terms of stunted development of youth, mental health and economic hardships for decades to come.

It is important for everyone across the world to support this non-violent fight for freedom against unscientific injection mandates. To see how unscientific they are, have a look at the official Ontario government statistics on infection rates for the vaxxed vs the unvaxxed at https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data. Being vaxxed does not reduce transmission, this data certainly suggests.

I am so sorry that I can only give a small amount to support our Freedom Truckers but Trudeau and his policies have decimated my family with his draconian actions.  The actions of our child leader are reprehensible to the n'th degree.

This is the battle of good vs. evil -- freedom against the WEF's technofascist globalist takeover. We must empower the truckers to win or our futures will be pre-determined by a digital ID social credit system. Gofraudme is a sneak peak at what our future banks will do if you have "unacceptable views."<br />Go Truckers!

Rules need to be applied fairly and be the same no matter the cause. What was done with the original fundraiser was awful

### 🇨🇦 Jamie L.
I am very embarrassed over the behaviour of our prime minister; it is very clear to me that he has been out for his own self interest for the past two years, and not for the best interests of the average Canadian. Only after the mandates are dropped can the healing begin. Thank you guys for standing up for every Canadian, even if some of us don't appreciate it.
