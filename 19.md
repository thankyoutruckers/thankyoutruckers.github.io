I am pleased to support the trucker protest against the irrational vaccine passport mandates and all other ill-founded public health measures. The politicians and public health institutions clearly are not promoting a holistic picture of public health with their preoccupation with ineffective measures to the exclusion of steps to better risk stratify and to promote immune system health.

Jesus was reborn as a trucker. A better idea than giving the extra funds to Veterans would be to use it to pay the truckers' upcoming legal fees. You do this and those millions will never stop rolling in. I am praying for justice.

The shofar blower must  three sets, three times.Finally there is tekiah gedolah: a very long blast. Teruah Hebrew tĕrūʽāh shout or blast of war
