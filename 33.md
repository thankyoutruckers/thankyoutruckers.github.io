My parents went through WWII in their early years, escaped communism, and settled in a used-to-be-free US.  I get to live through the COVID war in my later years to help gain back freedoms they had.  What the world has become is unacceptable.  Freedom is not free.  PLEASE keep fighting!

My donation is small and insignificant, but I support those in all nations resisting the kakistocracy that has infected the world. The virus is not the Covid pathology, it is our "leadership". Perhaps the truckers can remind them that their position is not theirs by right, but was granted to them by the people they are betraying.

A very big THANK YOU to all our truckers, who kept us well supplied during the last two years of the COVID party.  You were essential during this time, and you remain essential now and into the future.  Very sad that JT has decided to vilify the few unvaccinated truckers as of January 15 with this totally unnecessary border vaccine mandate measure.  JT has to know that Canada is NOT China!

Freedom  for Canada 

### 🇺🇸 John C.
Instead of performing in black face, Justin Trudeau’s time would have been better spent looking up the definition of “freedom”. Personal choices + personal consequences = freedom. Canada is one small step behind New Zealand. Canadians, please do not become sheep! Stand up for your inherent rights and kick any/all “leaders” who believe that they dictate what individual rights you have to the curb!

### 🇨🇦 Lord C.
The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid.

Thank you, hang in, may many more people and dollars boost this action to end this evil.

### 🇨🇦 Marc B.
That's four times what I gave GoReFundMe.  My daughter loved her day at the Truck parade fair; she got to honk a horn, slide down the bouncy castle, and enjoy hot chocolate. <br /> Granola bars and Hot Paws were offered when she got cold.  Ottawa has never been cleaner, and I had my own Mary Tyler Moore moment, surrounded by horns and engines, feeding off our energy.  Stick it to Fancy Socks!  Go Go Go

### 🇨🇦 Chad  C.
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts Truckers♥️<br />Your willingness to sacrifice your comfort, time with your families, and the energy it takes to be in this for the long haul is truly inspiring!<br />Trudeau is a weak, scared tyrant, and these Truckers are showing the world how despicable he is! Let Canada be an inspiration to the world! We stand together till the end against tyranny!<br />FreedomForAll♥️

### 🇨🇦 Wendy D.

### 🇨🇦 James Z.
My prayer is that this venture will come to a successful conclusion.  The government needs to stop dehumanizing a large part of Canadians.       <br /> CTV National "news" should stop their hate speech and just limit their content to reporting facts.<br />From a global perspective, how does Canada compare to China or Russia

### 🇨🇦 Ivana G.
Thank you to everyone who’s had the courage to stand up against the “majority” and fight for our freedom and rights. You guys have brought tears to my eyes. Seeing everyone come together for justice is really heartwarming. You have given me so much hope for the future and everyone who has supported this movement are real heroes. Thank you so much and may god bless your souls. Keep spreading love

### 🇺🇸 DAVID P.
Until "Lord Trudeau" deals honorably with the trucker's requests, I pray that they continue.  Also, if US AG Merrick Garland is colluding with ANY fascists in the Canadian government and reading this (insert a Gaelic vulgarity here). <br />

### 🇺🇸 Constance  M.
Make sure no  one is displaying a  swastika anywhere, and no one is displaying any words like "Trump" or "MAGA" because if you allow that at all, the Far Left will come after you and discredit your whole movement.  And your movement is not about any of those things.  Vaccine mandates do not prevent people from getting Omicron. We stand with our Canadian friends!  

### 🇺🇸 Cindy and Greg  N.

### 🇨🇦 James V.
God bless GiveSendGo for providing us with a way to financially support our brave Canadian truckers and supporters who are peacefully protesting the Canadian government's dictatorial mandates that are illegally forcing vaccines upon our citizens. After 'the other crowdfunding website' disgracefully refused to provide the truckers with the funds raised for them, I'll never use it again.

### 🇺🇸 Jennifer L.
Thank you for standing against tyranny! 

### 🇺🇸 Jolene O.
Thank you Truckers!  It is working.  Others have taken your lead like Australia, New Zealand, UK.  I think the reason all these blue states in the USA have stopped the mask mandates is there were rumors that truckers here in the USA were going to start a protest starting in CA to DC and the local and federal governments did not want that. And it is an election year. This is my second donation.

### 🇺🇸 Lindsay L.
Thank you so much for everything you are doing. I have no doubt that we will soon have our freedoms back and it will all be thanks to the brave truckers!!

### 🇨🇦 Martin C.
During World War II, many Canadians went overseas to fight the evil tyranny that had befallen other countries and that threatened the world back then. The torch of freedom has been passed down from them to us and now we are fighting evil tyranny again - this time in our own country of Canada. We must get involved in the fight; to do otherwise would be to betray their efforts and sacrifice. 

### 🇨🇦 Joel L.
Keep it up.  We finally have a voice.

### 🇨🇦 John K.
Fully vaxxed, but I believe the Canadian Government has lost all credibility.  It is obvious that the pandemic is winding down to endemic because of low death rate Omicron becoming the norm. Truck drivers (isolated in a cab) are not going to be the source of significant COVID deaths. It is simply government having poor thinking, over-reach in regulation and divisiveness. Sad times in Canada.

I only donated $6 originally.  But Trudeau said he would pursue US donors so I donated 12.  Then Mark Carney said "anyone sending money to the convoy should be in no doubt, you are funding sedition."  So here I am donating $24.  Keep flapping your globalist jowls.   I will keep doubling my donations.  "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable."  JFK.<br />Honk!

Triple vaccinated by choice but freedom is paramount! The suffering that restrictions have caused far outweighs any benefits and it’s founded on poor science.
