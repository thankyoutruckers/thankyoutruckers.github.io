Canadian truckers have shown enormous courage challenging 21st century tyranny. Puppet-leaders of democratic governments following the orders of a psychopathic global elite are close to achieving total control, ushering in a One World Government of rulers and serfs.

I didn't know you Canadian's had it in you after the Government seized your guns/rifles.

A huge portion of our population (with common sense) support this movement, and we can show it with our monetary support!

Everytime I see someone complaining about the convoy I will be donating money in their name!  Tweet from twit<br /><br />Realize that the "#TruckersConvoy" and copycat demonstrations are not about vaccines; they aren't about freedom. They are classic reactionary tactics to disrupt society and force it toward a return to right-wing power hegemonies that end freedoms, open inquiry, and rule of law.

I am doubly vaccinated as it was mandated by my company Nov.1 I saw it as a vaccination against homelessness rather than covid. I have been flying as a flight attendant the whole time, been exposed to covid and flew the India route during the delta variant more times than I can remember. I just tested positive for covid. By the way it’s a cold. You can’t mandate something that doesn’t even work!

Freedom!

### 🇨🇦 JohnPaul A.
I don't take "science" advice from a drama-teacher, and neither should you.  When the government decided to mandate experimental medical treatments and thus force me to take vaccines and wear masks against my will, they dissolved our individual sovereignty.  Once the freedom to choose what goes into your body has been taken away, it will never come back.  Continue the protest until freedom is won.

### 🇨🇦 Diana H.
Thank you so much for all you are doing.  You are the heroes.  I am sorry some people haven’t realized that you can’t comply your way out of communism.   The WEF and all their minions can go to .  We stand with you proudly!

What would you do with that freedom Will you keep standing And many years from now, you'll be able to tell your children that you stood and told the enemies of liberty, "You may take our lives, but You will never take our freedom."
