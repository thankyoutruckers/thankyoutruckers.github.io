Seeing how hard the media is trying to spin this into something it is not is quite telling. The fact that the government is too scared to even address this is a shame. Keep pushing on the cowards that make up our federal government. At the very least, they should have the balls to address the peaceful protestors at parliament.

### 🇨🇦 Ed M.

The people behind the Freedom Convoy 2022 are real heroes.  they are not inciting violence like the media is spewing as usual.

From my heart, thank you all for standing up.<br />My family two young children robbed of years of their childhood, a teacher who is ready for her students to be kids again and myself a father who wants his kids to experience red rover.

Originally donated $20. Now I will donate almost

### 🇬🇧 Duncan C.
As a Brit, where we do things in miniature and apologetically, it's so inspiring and moving to see those huge, chrome- and flag-decorated trucks rolling along in the freedom convoy, full of hope!<br />My small contribution expresses how historic I see this Freedom movement to be.<br />Oh - I'm an ex-Leftie/one-time Green party supporter, by the way, I don't do Left-Right Coke-Pepsi shadowplay BS any more.

### 🇺🇸 June W.
Your courage to stand for freedom is an inspiration.<br />I wish I had more to give.<br />I will do my best to encourage others to send you more.

Hoping GFM's disdain for freedom helps you raise a LOT more money through GSG. Give your young totalitarian no valid reason to break up the protest.  Keep it peaceful. Best of luck!

### 🇨🇦 Robyn R.
We both have lost our jobs to these idiotic mandates, and we previously donated $225 on the now-soon-to-be-defunct other platform. This time, we are giving US$1,000, and although we need this money, it is more important for the movement to have it. God bless everyone doing the right thing and supporting this.

### 🇺🇸 Ryan O.
Gofundme is a bunch of lying, cheating, thieves.  Doubling my previous contribution.  This is not a protest about vaccines.  We oppose government overreach in the form of coercive mandates.  Mandates = government violence.  It's the only way government knows how to ensure compliance.  No mandates.  Choose peace.  Choose personal freedom in healthcare.

I'm in Anchorage Alaska and I'm sending this to keep the truckers protesting in Ottawa to inspire Americans and the world to do the same.

### 🇺🇸 Susan S.
You have sparked something around the globe. You should all be so proud of the stand you are taking and how you are doing it. There are millions of people supporting you and politicians, big tech, media are all trying to stop us. It is frightening.

Sorry you had to learn the hard way. I would never donate using GFM, which is Go F*** Me site. They are 100% against anything true patriot.<br /><br />I hope that all those that gave request a refund and not wait for the auto refund. I head it will cost them plenty.

### 🇨🇦 audrey z.
This is the time to allow for open scientific debate, which has been shut down.  Vaccinate the vulnerable and allow for early treatment for everyone.  Science is never settled.  it is about knowledge.  We could have defeated this without mandates, if scientists on both sides were given a chance to speak.  They were censored and called names. the same old pattern used now on the truckers.

### 🇺🇸 carol s.
Bless you all we will send this site so our friends and family can donate!!!

I increased my donation from that of my GFM donation by 2x.   Words cannot describe my gratitude; these brave men and women of courage and selflessness, who are fighting for all us Canadians.  <br />I pray that the vaccine mandates will end soon so that I will be permitted to see my almost 88 yr old mother before she dies. This brings me to tears every single day.

### 🇨🇦 Joanne M.

### 🇨🇦 Daniel M.
We are not the government's slaves. Our body belongs to us and as such, they should not dictate what we should or should not inject in our bodies.<br />They claim we have choice... but that's like the robber putting a g-u-n to your head and saying "Your money or your life!" <br />Being forced to choose between two unacceptable options is not free choice...

God Bless these men and women fighting for freedom and common sense.  New York State requires boys to wear a mask while wrestling.  Because, you know, "science."
