Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful.

It is incredible to me that Canadians, always so “polite” and “complacent” according to U.S. stereotypes, are stepping up to the current tyrannical control the governments of North America are imposing during the current Social Marxist revolution, while citizens of the U.S.A. are meekly accepting government lies and media propaganda like a flock of  sheep.

Vaccines don't stop spread.  This is clear.  There is no societal benefit, there is no rationale for mandates.  This is for individual protection only.  Children, young people who have recovered, face no significant risk.   <br /><br />We can make our own choices!!!  Government, leave those kids alone!
