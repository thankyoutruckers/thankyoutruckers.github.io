God Bless every one of you.  Who would have THOUGHT that you would be the boots on the ground to bring freedom back to Canada!! I never thought it could be taken away from us, so forcefully and so hatefully.  The devastation in the wake of fear mongering and spreading discrimination have resulted in broken families, friendships, lost jobs, bankrupt businesses, foreclosures, suicides etc.

Thank you freedom convoy 2022 

### 🇨🇦 R B.
You are stepping into the gap for the sake of Canada's future.  This isn't about vaccines - I'm double vaxxed - it's about freedom of thought, conscience and speech; freedom from censorship, coercion and manipulation by an ideologically possessed government and state sponsored media.  Our children deserve the freedoms we enjoyed when we were young, which our parents fought to protect.  Thank you!

“Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.”<br /><br />― Ronald Reagan
