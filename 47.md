These truckers are nonviolent freedom fighters. If they lose, we all lose. Everyone who reveres Constitutional freedoms has a moral obligation to support these men. They have homes, families, bills to pay. They are putting themselves and their livelihoods at risk for principles on which all our lives depend.

First: Do no harm. <br /><br />Secondly: Tell the whole truth. A half truth is a half lie.<br /><br />Informed consent, includes the right to refuse.<br /><br />I stand with the truckers for: Freedom of choice. Non-violent right to protest. Choice versus corporate greed and corruption.<br /><br />Is it time for Mr. Trudeau to resign If he can coaxed into leaving his hiding place and face the honest people of this country, of course.<br />

I support the truckers just because enforced vaccine policy isn't right especially the experimental one. Truckers voice is my voice. just because of my son refusing to get the vaccine, he is told to stay home for a year when he was planning return to university for the second year. Now the fact is telling us the vaccine is ineffective.

The Awakening<br /><br />There was a mass awakening;<br />It happened on a lawn,<br />Below a clock and near a flame–<br />Occurred from dusk till dawn.<br /><br />The people started seeing– <br />That they could live again;<br />In ways so free, they shed deceit<br />And embraced their fellow man.<br /><br />Paid propagandists slandered,<br />But their lies did could not undo–<br />The uniting peaceful movement<br />That relied on deeper Truth.<br />

The Division in this world needs to end. We all need to come together. We need less power tripping Governments like Trudeau who thinks he owns the people, and thinks we're all . The Government should be a voice of the people period. This is about the Freedom to choose, what you want to put in your body, who you want to see, go where you want to go, whenever you want to go there. <br />

### 🇺🇸 Joe H.
I’m a Canadian living free in Texas. Keep up the great work! Don’t stop until Canada is a free country again.

I pray for all of you brave souls stating down the faces of adversity in Ottawa.  Things are going to get tough now as the City of Ottawa has now declared the State of Emergency.  We are very close to victory as they are showing their panic and fear, but now they will start swinging.  You have done so much so quickly, but do not place yourselves in extreme danger.  We love you out in the Fringes!
