It is time for children to freely play, explore and discover all the wonders as we did as kids.  It is time for students to have a FULL education,academics, sports, clubs, social funtions and even those awesome parties.  It is time for the sick and dying to be with family and friends.  A friend is a trucker, farmer, an Amish, a freedom supporter you haven't met.   Say hi and have a new friend.

The truckers are an inspiration.  They are doing the double duty of showing how a real peaceful protest works (i.e. no fires or shooting) and exposing the hypocrisy of government, corporate media, and the tech giant.s

We back the Freedom Convoy, the tip of the spear to overthrow tyranny brought on by the radicals and criminals that are trying to overthrow our way of life. They describe patriotism and support of our constitution as insurrection and an assault on democracy.  They paint our history as oppressive while attacking our police and family units; BLM is allowed to Burn, Loot, . Soros must go!

### 🇺🇸 Chandler H.
America stands with Canada & stands for freedom!

Freedom for all!

Wanting freedom not to participate in a scientific lie that is being perpetrated upon us by "beneficent", "wise", politicians who after all are the managers of the system that we groan under (yes we voters are to blame as well because of their "believable" promises) who in spite of their "superior wisdom", that wisdom got us to where we are now.<br /><br />Full apologies and resignations preferred.

Appuyons les camionneurs et les organisations pacifiques qui les supportent. Écoutons les experts médicaux et les dirigeants qui le disent de plus en plus : les mesures comme le passeport sanitaire et la vaccination coercitive sont non seulement discriminatoires, mais aussi inefficaces. Le Canada doit apprendre à vivre avec le virus comme plusieurs autres pays sur la planète le font actuellement.
