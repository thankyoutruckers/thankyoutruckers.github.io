Million thanks to brave truckers and all patriots who’ve participated in this remarkable movement. “A fringe minority of group of people” It sounds Trudeau not only admires dictatorship but also learnt some distinctive vocabulary, forgetting diversity and inclusion so quickly.

I didn't give to the GoFundMe, but what those corporate insects pulled was so shady I think the truckers deserve better.<br /><br />Donating here is the only way to show GoFraudMe for the parasites they really are.

### 🇨🇦 Darrell A.
Thank you for doing this.

### 🇨🇦 Jose G.
Hello, I donated $5 on Gofundme and now I've doubled it to $10 on Givesendgo since it got deleted. I am not a racist right-winger as the corporate media wants to think, I'm not even white. Does that put me in the fringe minority I'm just against authoritarian, anti-democratic mandates. Let the people make their own decisions. Respect for everyone black, yellow, right-wing, left-wing who agree.

Lessons can be learnt from unchecked government overreach from Martin Niemöller's poem;<br /><br />First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a socialist.<br />Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a trade unionist.<br />.....<br />Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.<br /><br />

We increased our original donation at gofundme of $20, to $100 here!  Keep doing what you’re doing Truckers!  Nothing but support and love from Tennessee USA! 

### 🇨🇦 Dylan  G.
They believe they can stop this movement by cancelling our original donations to freedom.  They are wrong. Now is our time to realize that the government even more corrupt. HONK HONK Justin. Its time to come out of your hiding spot and face the nation.  We will be heard.  This is about freedom!

Wow, did GoFMe show their black and white stripes clearly.  Anyone who uses them to start a fundraiser, or who gives them a tip when donating to one already going, is an idiot.  Pried my refund out of the claws of GoFMe, doubled it to  them, added a tip for GiveSendGo server upgrades and donated here.  Please do the same.

### 🇺🇸 John E.
God bless all those that are part of this movement fighting for freedom from tyranny for all of humanity.  May God keep you all safe and send his Archangel Michael to defend you in battle, to be your protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil, May God rebuke him, and all those doing his evil deeds.  GoFundMe has denied you, but I am doubling my original donation here.  God Bless GSG

I'm tired of the state and country taking away my constitutional rights under the guise of public safety. We have to live with this disease because it's not going away. We should have the right to say what goes into our body. What was "science" a year ago is now misinformation...it's time we start doing our own research and stop listening to the talking heads of the governments.<br />

For freedom! I am pro vax and believe in the scientific method but if you lose your job or career over this or are denied entry into a grocery store then we have a problem.

Never give up. The totalitarian, globalist revolution by the elites must be stopped by the people.

Think not, O man, the Gods always deliver the nations of the earth in a day or by miracles.  They go to the foundation of the matter; they make man a servant to help deliver Himself.  They stir up the nations in rites and ceremonies.  And the women look on, receiving the spirit of the matter in their souls, the which entaileth on their offspring that which is desired.
