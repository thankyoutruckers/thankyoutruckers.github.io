I support the end of mandates. <br />It’s clear they are not serving their intended purpose.  It’s time to have proper discourse on the issue and change policy.  Where is Prime Minister Trudeau  He is failing Canadians in his absence and failing to bring the country together.  Instead he is continuing on this path of divisiveness.  We can disagree and still find common ground.  - Whitby, ON

Prayers from the USA for a successful, peaceful protest.  In the words of RFK Jr. "No one ever complied their way out of tyranny."  Never before have I felt such a sense of brotherhood with the citizens of other countries as in these last two years.  The globalists made a big mistake!  We stand together in non-compliance while respecting the sovereignty of each nation's citizens.

This tyranny must end.  The misrepresentation of this struggle for Freedom by the MSM is truly disgusting.  Focusing every individual wingnut and provocateur, but failing to show the true scale and motivation of the people.  Coerced vaccinations of an experimental treatment to earn a living or even freely move about society is truly dystopian.  God Speed Truckers.  Give Justin a 2 AM wake up call!

You guys/gals are fantastic!! Keep up the amazing work!  Last year CBC got 1.4B from the federal gov't so it figures they won't give a true account of all the great things you are doing in Ottawa and throughout Canada.  Shine on  and know more Canadians support the Convoy than do the Liberal Gov't.  Libs are currently at 28.8 support nationally. The one clear racist in Ottawa is Trudeau. BLACKFACE

Everyone should withdraw their donation to GoFundMe, you have until Feb 19th to do that, and then resubmit the donation through GiveSendGo. <br />GoFundMe should face litigation for wire fraud.  <br />Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson should face the consequences of conspiracy to defraud by conspiring with GoFundMe to deprive Incorporated Freedom 2022 Human Rights and Freedom Association of its funds.

With this donation of 25$ USD I intend to support a peaceful protest by the Canada Freedom Convoy 2022 and the supporting protesters. This comment serves as a record that I the donor: is NOT indenting to support acts of Violence, Terrorism, nor Racism, and the donor waives responsibility if these unintended events occur. The added donation of 2$ is to support the web infrastructure for the Convoy.

Keep on trucking!  Freedom!

Thank you so much Canadians from the bottom of my heart. Here in the states the government has divided the people so much so that we will fight with each other instead of for our freedoms and that is the politicians' plan. Thank you for showing how when people (truckers) unite and we support them we can stand together to keep our God given freedoms peacefully as He intended.

Thank GoFundMe for this donation. Their bait-and-switch tactic is completely inappropriate. Thank you, GiveSendGo. 

### 🇺🇸 Richard M.
I would have contributed earlier, but I won't make donations through Go Fund Me, because of their partisan policies.

enough is enough of these senseless mandates.  It's cruel to mask a child when children have no risk from this. It's cruel to imprison healthy people. It's pointless to keep borders closed when the virus is already everywhere.  It's fraudulent to jab people with natural immunity. The Left wants to keep these going for as long as they can.  We have to stop them because they won't on their own.

I have decided to give more to this than the GoFundMe Campaign. Not only do the attacks legitimize the cause, it is also revealing the now outrageously spiritual dimension manifesting itself in this battle. Having it on the website accentuates this fact.
