Love the peaceful stance for freedom to stop the communist ways of the left. Study communism and socialism. See how they came to power and brutalize and control their people. I read that North Korea even puts some people to death with a flamethrower, and I have no doubt. They have complete power to do as they wish. I'm not comparing North Korea to Canada, however, the left wants absolute control.

It says remaining donations will be given to veterans' groups.   If that is the case, which I think is wrong here, please carefully research those veterans groups.  In the US, none of the leaders of these organisations spoke against Biden's tragic mismanagement of Afghanistan.  But all of them strongly criticized Trump and his administration, despite the vast improvements he made with the VA.

God is good. He knows what He's doing.  He's been doing God-things a long time.  He has kind of a knack for His unique job---managing world events and personal events.  He cares about us, has nothing but the best interests of all of us in mind. He provides everything we need to carry His message of Freedom and Good Will.  We can trust God completely to accomplish His work.
