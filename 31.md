As a proud Canadian citizen I support the truckers and their families. I can not travel back to Canada from the UK as I am unvaccinated and I refuse to vaccinate my children also. My eldest will be 12 this summer. Mandates are wrong. People are people regardless of their vaccination status. These people standing up to the government elect are doing so for all Canadian citizens and their families.

People are trusting "scientific" summaries from liability free, convicted corporate felons who have paid billions in criminal fines for offenses including falsifying study data and bribing doctors, and these corporations want to hide the actual data for 55 years, despite promising full transparency at the start.

I'm old and triple-vaxed but I support the truckers. “Their bodies, their call.” Freedom from "trespass to the person" is a centuries old right.<br />The protest itself is nearly perfect.  Noisy, even disruptive, yes.  That's what it takes to grab attention.  Peaceful and non-violent yet forceful.  <br />A shameful response by media and politicians: insults and trying to pit Canadian against Canadian.

### 🇺🇸 susan  c.
Thank all of you... Trucker's, Farmer's and all other freedom fighters for fighting for human freedom. This is the turning point the world needs.  God is with you and so are so many others

End the Government/ Bureaucrat Covid Tyranny. Western civilization is under attack. The corrupt press is nothing more than a propaganda arm for Tranny of a corrupt government’s. Plato and Aristotle define a Tyrant as a person that rules without law, using extreme and cruel methods against both his own people and others. ( Example mask mandates, vaccine mandates, lockdowns of the populations)

### 🇺🇸 Thomas M.
Here is to the common man who just wanted to be left alone.  That time however, has come and gone.  God Bless These Trucker Patriots. Time for the us to stand tall and throw off this tyranny.  The Biden Administration is next.  Stay Strong Brothers, Texans and the USA are 100% behind you!

I gave twice over the last two days. I’m giving again because Trudeau said I’ll be charged for giving to the Truckers. Maybe I have ODD, but for sure I don’t like a rat-faced, black-faced communist telling me what to do. My Irish American family loves the Truckers.

Trudeau has demonized those who chose not to be vaccinated. He refers to them as a fringe minority, as if 10% to 15% of the population was nothing. He seems to forget that a great number of people were forced to be vaccinated because they could not afford to lose their job - they had to feed their family. They are not happy either. The Freedom Convoy is our only hope. Trudeau met his match.

### 🇺🇸 Dawn M.
Thank you for standing up! Let freedom ring!

Having been under the thumb of a tyrant Governor for 2 years now, we are quite sympathetic to the insanity you're being subjected to.  The inability to admit errors and make course corrections is simply a mental illness.

### 🇨🇦 Brendan  A.
From Vancouver, Thank you for the hope and fighting for my families freedom! We finally found our heroes, and in the most unexpected place. I will never forget what you have done. You will be remembered in Great Canadian Lore for the Ages.

Praying for them to be steadfast and diligent. Praying for them and their families to be taken care of financially and to be protected from harm

### 🇺🇸 Nicholas K.
Truck Brudeau!  If any Americans hadn’t donated to our neighbors yet Trudeau just got them off the fence.  Nothing will get our pocket books out like an out of touch, elitist, -wasted, communist leader of a foreign country telling Americans that if they donate to our like minded patriot neighbors up north, that he will try to criminally prosecute them.  Thanks for helping the cause, idiot!

### 🇨🇦 Jody O.
PROUD IS ALL I CAN SAY.  VERY PROUD. PIVOTAL POINT IN CANADIAN AND WORLD HISTORY I PRAY!

### 🇨🇦 Errol A.
Thank you all for standing for freedom against the elites who are primarily interested in control of our lives. It scares me that so many Canadians are brainwashed and are unable to think for themselves, they love having government and some BIG MEDIA tell them what to do. WAKE THEM UP!

I was in Ottawa this weekend. So many families. Such Unity and Joy. The truckers thanked me. It seemed odd at first because they were pulling most of the weight but someone reminded me we are all in this together. God bless you all!

Evil is rising all over this globe.  God bless EVERYONE brave enough to stand up to that evil.  There are forces at work to extinguish freedom.  The world will fall into dark ages if they are successful.  Dear Heavenly Father, watch over and protect these wonderful people making a stand.  Their cause is righteous.  I pray you arm them to be successful in this battle against evil.  Amen.

Truckers are the last foot in the door stopping totalitarianism, GREAT RESET, CCP/ESG CREDIT SCORE from settling in and ruining rights and freedoms. To destroy what makes each of us have a respected spark of divinity given by GOD. Simply put, the ESTABLISHMENT is panicking, and pulling all the stop for the SJW agenda to push through... You're not only HEROES for CANADA but for the World.

### 🇺🇸 Lissa B.
THANK YOU for fighting for ALL our FREEDOM -<br />GOD BLESS YOU ALL !! 

### 🇺🇸 Valley H.
This is about so much more than the mandates. It's about fighting back against Orwellian left wing/Democrat (same thing)/Marxist media control like the kind used by GoFundMe. It's about the kind used by all the major media to black out the latest two Johns Hopkins studies showing the lockdowns did no good and the natural immunity is better than the vax.  No let the American side 'roll'. 

### 🇨🇦 Gary  M.
Thoughts and prayers are with you

### 🇺🇸 Carroll O.
God bless you folks and your families. Resist, persist and persevere.

Thanks guys and gals. Stay strong!

### 🇺🇸 Matthew A.
From North Carolina (USA) - as someone I know recently said, "Canadian Truckers have done more to promote TRUE FREEDOM in American than all the politicians (both side) in Washington DC" - A time of clarity is coming soon to American when the true patriots will be revealed. Only those speaking out publicly for FREEDOM are PATRIOTS!

May God bless and protect everyone involved in Freedom Convoy 2022!  May The Holy Spirit open the eyes of the minds and hearts of all politicians and all civil authorities of every kind so that they see that their freedom will be lost, too, in time, if Canada keeps going down the path of COVID-19 tyranny. Amen!
