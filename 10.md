Coercion of medical treatments is the slippery  for tremendously destructive avalanches carrying unforeseen potential for collateral damage -- in addition to the immediate crime of violation of consent and  integrity of the coerced individuals.

I want to confess. Confess to my own cowardice and weakness. I knew that this was nonsense since midway through 2020. Nightinggale hospitals going empty and camps being built.<br /><br />And while I did stamp on my mask in open defiance at the voting booth, I was too cowardly to say anything to the people I know. I am deeply sorry for this.<br /><br />No more!  to my cravenness! Come the hour, come the man!

Thanks standing up for freedom. It's time for the government <br />of Canada to learn that they will be held accountable. Trudeau's recent actions are those of a despot and a tyrant. Because of you, he's now undergoing the painful process of learning that the people of Canada do not allow tyranny. "And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up" (Gal 6:9).

Trudeau has made a mockery of his own people. <br /> In America we have to pretend that a man that can hardly walk, much less talk is "in charge". <br />NBC, CBS, ABC insists that we pretend we are blind, deaf and dumb.<br />As an America I have always trusted Canada more than my own Country.<br />Now I know why.

As a Christian, freedom is more valuable than safety in any society (though both are important). Only through freedom of conscience can individuals come to saving faith in Jesus. Love cannot be mandated. Therefore, freedom is absolutely essential to love Christ and to eternal salvation. Praying for the peaceful and godly ends of this campaign! "Give me Liberty or Give me Death". 

### 🇺🇸 Justin  W.

I’m not sure what annoys me more is how Canada is treating the truckers or that   ‘go fund me ‘  was going to steal all the prev donated money. That is outrageous. I will never donate to ‘go fund me ‘again.

### 🇺🇸 Al B.
You've inspired freedom loving people around the world and in the process you've got politicians and authoritarians shaking in their boots.  When they start threatening you that's when you need to work hardest to hold the line as that's right when they're on the verge of failure.  KEEP IT UP!!  We are cheering for you every step of the way!

Its time! It’s time to protect our individual rights and freedoms, in a responsible way. After 2 years of ever changing mandates, lockdowns, promises (propaganda), hypocrisy with minimal results, it’s time that each of us takes back our freedom of choosing what’s best for us and our families. Thank you truckers, et al, for peacefully leading the way!

### 🇺🇸 Donald S.
Amazing job!<br />Keep up the good work until freedom is achieved.<br />So many overcomers are with you.

### 🇨🇦 Jean-Sebastien M.
I hope that some of this money can be used to support protests in other provincial capitals. In any case, thank you to everyone involved.

### 🇺🇸 Brian P.
Keep pushing back! 

### 🇺🇸 Vance L.
i'm sorry to hear what our USA communist party of gomefund did to the Canada Truckers that are standing up for both sides Vax and un-Vax for FREEDOM. i hope my family gets their money returned to re donate on this site. I'm sad to see America so far behind (standing up for freedom) but extremely proud of these Canada truckers and Farmers that recently joined.<br />keep up the amazing work<br />

### 🇺🇸 Benny W.
God bless this movement.

### 🇨🇦 l b.
History: authoritarian regimes have always called truth "misinformation" and share/push their propaganda/misinformation and call it truth. Bought and paid for public broadcasting of the message<br /><br />Maybe this time is different<br /><br />FREEDOM from the davos ogliarchs and their useful idiots<br /><br />FREEDOM from censorship<br /><br />FREEDOM from tyranny<br /><br />FREEDOM for our children and their future!!

### 🇺🇸 Harold  O.
Let’s go Brandon
