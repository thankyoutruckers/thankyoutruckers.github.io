I am so proud of these Canadian Truckers and their fight for freedom. If we have no control over our bodies then we are just slaves of these tyrannical "government representatives". These politicians are supposed to be public servants, but see themselves as our lords and masters. It is time they were put in their place. The people are the government, and it is time to take our power back.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart! I was vaccine injured in 2009. So my doctor recommended that I do not take this shot.

It should not matter why I’m not vaccinated, I should have never been made to feel like I was less as a human.

I work at a grocery store and see every day how much stuff is transported.  These men and women have been bringing food, medicine, retail goods, even vaccines this whole time.  It's sad to see the media and government demonize them.  I have a lot of respect for all the truckers and I want to thank everyone in the convoy.  A lot of people in Canada and around the world are supporting you!  From BC.

### 🇺🇸 Benjamin C.
I'm not going to lie, as a duel citizen living in the US, watching what has happened in Canada over the last few years has been disheartening in the extreme. It seemed like all of Canada was going to a dark place and might not come back, but watching the support that has come out for you all has really given me a new hope and pride for my country. This is the real Canada. Godspeed and good luck!
