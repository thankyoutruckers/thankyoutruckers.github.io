It has long been said that fighting fire with fire is a lost cause. Fighting clowns with honks, however, appears to be quite effective in the nonsensical world we now find ourselves in. Do not relent, ignore the propaganda, and know that every single one of you are an inspiration not just to your fellow Canadians, but to countless people all around the globe. Godspeed and good honking.

"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.

From all of my family - Thank You Truckers! You are fighting for all of us, for those who are being coerced and threatened into injecting themselves, for those who have already and are now suffering debilitating adverse reactions, for those who have lost loved ones to the toxic jab.

Freedom of choice should remain free.  God bless you all and your protest too!

Just found out family members can't travel out of the continent because of bogus positives. Since when are grown adults told when they can and can't travel - as if we're too dumb to know when they're sick and contagious & the government has to tell us!  And whatever happened to HIPPA!  This is global government tyranny and treason. Thank you, Canadian truckers, for all you're doing!

### 🇨🇦 Adrian B.
My Nationality is Trinidadian, I have brown skin and I was born in Canada. I was so proud to be a Canadian and grow up in the free world of opportunity. Trudeau has sold out the country I love to China and is using Propaganda/Tyranny to mold this country in his image. This evil Canada that oppresses people based on vaccinated status is not the country I love. It is clear the mandates need to stop.
