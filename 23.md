“We went after the funding. Our efforts, combined with the city’s efforts, eliminated the GoFundMe. $10 million (is) no longer accessible to the demonstrators,”<br /><br />Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly (quote from Global News 2022-02-07 article) 

### 🇺🇸 Ron L.
"Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States [And Canada] where men were free."<br />- Ronald Reagan
