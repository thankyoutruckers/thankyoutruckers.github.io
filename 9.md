Help protect Canada from a tyrannical government whose marching orders come not from ordinary Canadians but from Geneva, Klaus Schwab's global elitist headquarters and there Build Back Better agenda for 2030. People have had enough of being manipulated by the global elite and told what to do. These mandates have nothing to do with protecting health but everything to do with taking away your freedom and having control over every aspect of your life so these global elitists can rule the world.

### 🇨🇦 Martin U.

Honoured to contribute to a cause our entire family is deeply committed to. Authoritarianism and the deeply divisive nature of 'Team Trudeau' have no place in Canada.

Stay safe everyone. #HonkHonk

### 🇺🇸 HOLLY B.
Behind you 100% and ready to lay it all on the line. We have no choice, the political landscape as it stands is about to end us.  Our freedom to live our lives, as we have known it, is over anyway, if we don't rise up and fight right now.

"The perfect dictatorship would have the appearance of a democracy, but would basically be a prison without walls in which the prisoners would not even dream of escaping. It would be essentially a system or slavery where through consumption and entertainment the slaves would love their servitudes." Aldous Huxley

Make sure you give extra to GiveSendGo when donating!<br /><br />They are the only option we have for fundraising left. The last bastion.<br /><br />If you do not help them stay afloat, we will be left to the mercy of the existing tech monopoly...and that means communism for all.<br /><br />So please, support not only these individual important causes, but the infrastructure that allows us to support them at all.

### 🇨🇦 Dillon  H.

Revelation 18.23 says that ALL the nations will be deceived by sorcery. Look up the original Greek of the word sorcery. It’s pharmakeia, with the meaning also of drugs or medicine. Be not deceived, the devil is the father of lies, and corrupt governments are his bedfellow. Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God. Keep fighting! We are with you and so is God.

Thank you. This has inspired more Canadians and people around the world than anything in the past decade at least. Seeing the convoy has brought my wife and her friends to tears.

A loved one of mine has a blood clot disorder and has been advised my her doctor not to get the vaccine. She found out she had the disorder over 7 years ago. She got Covid in 2021. Her employer has been pressuring her to get the vaccine. No one should stick their nose into someone’s personal health, that should be between ones own self and their doctor. I pray for freedom for all.

By now it's clear that liberal politicians are using the pandemic to enforce a social change against any democratic means. The words and lies uttered by Canadian president Trudeau - among his leftist peers worldwide- against this demonstration are too ideological (and ), and many are beginning to realize what's happening. They feel their status his contested, let them know that we know.
