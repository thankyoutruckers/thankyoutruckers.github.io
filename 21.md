I'm a Canadian that chose vaccination.  But I'm so disappointed our government decided to sow division and hatred by making scapegoats out of truckers, nurses, care home workers and so many others that lost jobs because of forced vaccines.  Now I'm alarmed to see governments and media blaming these donations on 'foreigners'.  No, it's millions of Canadians that are saying coercion is just wrong.

I am an immigrant.  Corporate media is lying about the Truckers.  I am watching the independent media's honest coverage.  I am increasing my donation after what Gofundme did to your campaign.  You have the right to peacefully protest. I am worried that our politicians are acting like Authoritarians. It reminds me of back home.  I don't want that in Canada.  I want my freedom of choice.

Get in touch with police officers families and demand they demand their officers support Canadian's Charter Rights and refuse to comply with illegal orders NOW.   Just like Trudeau wants to sideline you from society, make sure they know these officers and their families will be sidelined if they continue to support these crimes against humanity.   

### 🇨🇦 Andréa B.
Thank You for Giving our World  HOPE AGAIN Freedom

### 🇨🇦 Rick M.
The law of God is the objective standard to which all men and all governments of men are accountable. If civil authorities make law, policy, or court opinion that is contrary to His law – the lesser magistrates are to interpose and stop the evil. 

### 🇨🇦 John D.
Many have thought about correcting the wrongs done by our government, don't necessarily agree with no vaccines. But being told what to do by a government that can not even follow the rules of law seems hypocritical.<br />

### 🇨🇦 Kieran M.

Truckers, you are mighty and right. This is the hill to die on. You represent the silenced voices of millions of ordinary working people, vaxxed and unvaxxed, standing up against a global elite seeking to crush every freedom our grandparents fought and died for.

"The only authority I recognize is that of God. A man may believe in freedom from tyranny and not be a rebel or a traitor. If he is not free to make up his own mind, that is the worst form of tyranny."

### 🇨🇦 Misha P.
I fully support the Freedom Convoy. These lockdowns are more damaging than the virus itself. Underprivileged communities are having severe negative impact. Teenagers and children are suffering depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. Canadians are divided. Adults with addictions and abuse is at an all time rise. People have lost their businesses, went bankrupt and jobless. FREEDOM CONVOY ❤️

to my Canadian cousins,<br /><br />Never surrender - Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.

### 🇺🇸 Wendy Z.
Referring to a peaceful protest as an attack on democracy is insane. Democracy is based on basic freedoms, which are expressed/debated and then "democratically" enacted. 

### 🇬🇧 Martin  T.
Your battle is everyone’s battle. <br /><br />Against  the WEF trained   Big Pharma sponsored new dictators.  <br />Trudeau in Canada, Adhern in New Zealand, Macron in France.<br />And the rest.<br /><br />Martin <br />London <br />UK

### 🇨🇦 Paul M.
Thank you for standing up to government tyranny.  This movement has been made famous by truckers but represents the sentiments of many medical professionals, police, firefighters, pilots, teachers, and Canadians in general.  We are thankful for the opportunities Canadian freedom has provided us in the past, and wish for this country to retain it's respect for human rights and  autonomy.

This is a time in history when you must decide if you will stand on the right side of the fence. Read the book, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45 by Milton Mayer. This will hopefully wake you up to what can happen if this doesn't end soon.
