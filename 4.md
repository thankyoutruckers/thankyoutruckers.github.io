GOFUNDME  has given into the BS spread by the Lying politicians and their propaganda machine. the Trudeau government says it will not talk to the truckers because of the hate flags seen in the protest ( 2 people likely infiltrators condemned by the protesters) Yet they just approved sending 100's of millions of our tax dollars to Neo Natiz in Ukraine. I am doubling my original donation.

Thank You for standing up for our children’s futures. It’s disgraceful what GoFundMe has done. <br /><br />Our government weaponized their hate speech to divide a nation.

We stand with peaceful Canadians that believe Canada is peace, love and respect and NOT hate, division, violence, segregation that is promoted by our current PM Justin Trudeau. With these funds we hope that we are investing in the removal of Justin Trudeau as PM as he does not represent Canadians or Canada. We are asking for A Vote of No Confidence and we hope for the success of this convoy.

God bless y'all. We are praying for your freedom (and ours) from tyrannical mandates. No policy should ever be one size fits all. Everyone's health is NOT the same and vaccines are not the answer for everyone, especially since they do not prevent the disease or its spread! And they are using fetal material to produce it. Masks are also problematic for asthmatics or others with pulmonary issues.

Covid vaccination campaign saved a lot of lives. However mandatory vaccination with untested and dangerous vaccines is just a crime against humanity. Especially in a situation, when vaccines do not help to prevent the spread of the virus. If you are afraid of the disease get the vaccine for yourself - you will be protected against death. Let other people make their own choice.

It is time for all to stand against the globalist tyranny. They stand for nothing but their own indulgences and their minions of associates and friends.

The GiveSendGo site is straining to keep up -- a good sign.<br /><br />The "Trucker Convoy" phenomenon has much the energy of the Gdansk Shipyard Strike in 1980.  The strike spontaneously inspired the Solidarity Moverment, and Solidarity took down an oppressive regime -- peacefully.<br /><br />The energy here is good.  Excellent.  We keep pressing.  We're winning.

This campaign exists because GoFundME does not care about freedom. They lie. Millions of people are involved and only a few instances of problems. If the same percentage of problems were found in a city of the same size populace you would think that was amazing. Do NOT let them and the other enslavers break us.

It's quite funny how GoFundMe allowed funds for the Antifi Chaz/Chop event where people were murdered but not a peaceful fun loving protest in Ottawa where the city actually saw a drop in crime since this 'occupation'. As long as I keep seeing the fun and peace in the livestreams for this protest, I will keep donating. GoFundMe out, GiveSendGo in :)
