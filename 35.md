The narratives spun by politicians and Legacy/Corporate Media are bunk! The curtain has been lifted exposing the power hungry mandating elitists who have  never cared about the working class/under belly citizenry.

Praying for the success of the protest.  Praying for those standing up, and making their voice heard for freedom from mandates.  The only kingdom I trust to have absolute authority is God's Kingdom, and any authoritarian overreach by any government here on earth should rightly be looked at with great weariness, and skepticism.

The fake depiction of this movement (i.e. violent, racist etc.) must stop and therefore, these truckers need support from all walks of life.  The support will be as much a symbol or more so than the truckers' themselves.  Overwhelming support will show that it can't be possibly racist while simultaneously showing how deep the dissatisfaction with runs.  This is our Boston Tea Party moment!

Thank you Truckers for what you are doing.  The mandates have to stop.  The vaccines are great, but they should be taken by choice only.  And no ones livelihood should be dependent upon taking it.  Prime Minister Trudeau is wrong not to sit down with the leaders of the protest and hear what they have to say.  I pray God give the truckers the courage and strength to see this to the end.

I fully support the Truckers protesting, I hope it spreads across the globe. I will stand up in my area when called to do so. God created us as free beings and no government has the right to tell us what to do with our bodies.  The Spread of Communist and fascist beliefs must be stopped. The Globalist Agenda's depopulation and hate of humanity must be stopped by the people. Thank you Truckers!

Politicians and bureaucrats don’t actually make things or deliver services, as they are useless at anything but suasion.  They are supposed to use suasion to serve people who make things and deliver services.  Society goes wrong when they no longer feel they need to use suasion if they are allowed to give themselves dictatorial powers… but they forget they can’t make things or render services.

Good Luck and thanks for bringing attention to this issue! Our fearless PM is being stubborn and doesn't want to discuss a pathway out of this pandemic. Like his other scandals he will announce some new law or program to divert our feckless media and the uninformed. Airlines cancel flights and beg for a reasonable testing/ entry policy. I am mad as  and I am not going to take it anymore!!!!
