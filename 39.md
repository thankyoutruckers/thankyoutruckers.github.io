I heard that the glowies hacked you recently, after talking about arresting donors.<br />This is a message to those  glowies.<br />The message is: <br />Truck you. You smell, you're lame, you're traitors, and you're enabling (or even committing) crimes against humanity. Get trucked.

This movement, which started in Canada, hopefully will spread to the rest of the world and effect the end of the vaccine mandates. Even more importantly, it may be the beginning of the world ridding itself of the specter of communism which is hanging over all of our heads.<br />If so, the so-called "common man" will be the true heroes once again, as they always are.

It is long overdue to regain Canadian freedoms. Canadian's rights and freedoms have been on the chopping block ever since the corrupt Liberal Party of Canada came to power in 2015. Each day they are in power more of our freedoms disappear.

Mandates destroy freedom. Masks hurt children. Vaccines allow infection and spread and according to VAERS cause death and damage. Treatments have been withheld, businesses shut down. The Great Barrington report, signed by over 60,000 doctors and scientists, offered a better way of protecting the vulnerable and allowing the normal activities to continue thus saving the livelihoods of people.

The Progressive elite will not listen, until they suffer the Principles they force on others. Force them to house illegals in their homes. Prohibit private security and confiscate guns from those that keep them from others. Foist 3 am raids on them, but first notify sympathetic media, so they can be ready to catch it on film.

Confiscate your funds Is that the goal of NDP joining Liberals, calling U.S. Ambassador David Cohen, saying American donations are "an attack on Canada's democracy"  Maybe you should the release the funds to the truckers now to block them. Another fund could be started.

Even as many countries and provinces acknowledge and respond to these legitimate protests by relaxing  and canceling lockdown mandates and restrictions, some dictatorial officials foolishly try to hang on to their baseless illegal agenda, making themselves look even more guilty.

### 🇺🇸 Christine P.
For every comment like this, I give!   She's a harvard prof @CNN of course.<br /><br />"The convoy protest, applauded by right wing media as a "freedom protest," is an economic and security issue now. The Ambassador Bridge link constitutes 28% of annual trade movement between US and Canada. Slash the tires, empty gas tanks, arrest the drivers, and move the trucks"

Thanks to the Americans for bailing us Canadians out (as usual).
