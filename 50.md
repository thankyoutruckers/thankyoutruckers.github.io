So PROUD of our northern neighbors. Keep up the pressure. Though I'm not a trucker, if I could get across the border I would definitely consider the drive.

Please, no violence. Protest with peaceful presence.   Mandates, executive orders and such like are for emergency use to override due process of law WHEN NEEDED. In a true emergency.
