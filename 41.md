There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part! You can't even passively take part!

The evil that has gripped the Western world is an absolute abomination. The suppression won’t work, it only brings the collusion and corruption more into light - it is shocking how deep the tentacles go and how much they are willing to lie to destroy freedom!

Don’t give in.  Canada must be a beacon to the world.  Look what Solidarity achieved in Poland in 1980.  They showed the state as a paper tiger in the face of true workers’ uprising.   Walesa went on to be a Nobel Prize winner and future president when the government and its apparatus would have had the people believe he was an enemy of the state. Trudeau is a puppet seditious traitor.  

### 🇨🇦 Peter S.
The Freedom Convoy will be a defining event in Canadian history. The drivers a taking a huge risk on our behalf and they deserve all the financial support that we can give them.
