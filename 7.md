I donated to gofundme when the Freedom Convoy was just starting. I am appalled but not surprised at the government's and media's response to these protests. Or that gofundme is proving once again that they are extremely biased politically. By stealing 90% of the fund they'll say they were in the right, so here's 5X the cash because I know we're the ones on the right side of history.

We live in a strange time where people who claim to be anti-Fascists are in fact, Fascists.  People who claim to be liberal are shockingly illiberal.  <br /><br />A recent Johns Hopkins University study has clearly shown that the LOCKDOWNS MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO COVID MORTALITY.<br />Those who claim to 'follow the science' ignore these studies.  The only 'experts' allowed are government owned.

Politicians do NOT have the right to force people to take a vaccine, to take away their jobs if they don't, to severely limit their freedom of movement.  Trudeau is a hateful person who should not be leading the country. Provincial premiers need to end vaccine mandates. Enough! <br />Thank you truckers!!!<br />From a peace loving, inclusive person who is 100% in support of the truckers convoy!!

God help us help ourselves in this time of crisis. My wife came from a Communist country, and she fears that we are almost already there here in Canada.

This movement has given me hope I've not felt in 2 years. Thank you for that!!! No one should be required to inject an experimental vaccine that used aborted stem cells in development. Much less one that does not stop the intended infection OR the spread. God bless and keep you all safe.

We donated $39 to go fraud me as 39 was our only childs favourite number and she passed away at only 12 yrs old.  The fact the corrupt cabal liberals, msm and police can lie to get the original funds held is disgraceful and criminal. So we are donating more. We all want our lives back free of corruption and lies. We’ve been lied to for a very  long time. The last 2 years have woke many up FREEDOM!

Thank you for picking up the slack here. This is the early phases of the war it looks like. I wanna make sure I'm backing the side of reality and truth. Our freedoms are being seized from us in the name of a secular religion called "Woke-ism." We are (belatedly) waking up the very real threat.

Have not felt these emotions in years.  I tear up when I see you guys trucking up the highways an seeing 1000's of small fringe Canadians with unacceptable views, handing you lunches, treats, drinks, pats on the back and little notes of encouragement.  THAT IS HOW I USE TO FEEL!  Take as long as you need!  Love your commitment.  Hold that line.  See you on the front line!  God Bless and God Speed!

GoFundMe has sided with leftists denying the $10M raised so people are waking up to this world wide tyranny. I suspect they might shut this down by force aswell... the radical left have many powerful friends.  If the Government can't do it lawfully but the Government can direct corporations to do it lawfully; this type of ideology has a name. Socialists condemn workers of the world for uniting lol

I support our friends and their beautiful, respectful, generous vision to fight for the truth and their way of being according to their values. All mandates down.

I wish we could pay in CND.

I applaud every trucker giving their time and efforts for Freedom!  Evidently Justin Trudeau does not care about Freedom, as he will not even give his time to these Patriots.  He is too busy hiding from them!  Ironic since he got the vaccine and got Covid, and yet he is mandating the truckers get the vaccine!

I am so glad you are no longer on the far left Go Fund Me platform.

I support peaceful grassroot protest to end vaccine mandates. I have nothing against vaccines as long as they are not showed down people's throats. Myself is fully vaccinated. I vaccinated before it was politicized and make the symbol of compliance <br />The latest vaccine mandate for truckers  after two years without seems more like the exercise of who is the boss than the health issue

Honk Honk Honk. If we don't get governments under control soon, people who want freedom and donating are soon going to be labeled "enemy of the state".
