Thanks to the Truckers for giving us a voice.  <br />We have been to the Ottawa protest multiple times and the message has been nothing but Peace, Love, Freedom and Unity!  This is the safest protest, so much so that I brought my children.

### 🇨🇦 Eric N.
Thanks for what you are doing! Our son is a college student at SAIT in Calgary and was forced to get the vaccine or drop out. He had a vaccine injury 5 days after the first shot and was diagnosed with Guillain Barre Syndrome. They still want him to get the second shot, though the specialist said he would likely have a worse reaction after the second one, possibly permanent disability or death! 

### 🇺🇸 Kim H.
The confiscation of the fuel for the truckers protesting for basic freedom is inhumane.  I pray that the Canadian authorities implementing this tactic rethink their coercion methods.  The mandate of a vaccine that doesn't prevent you from getting or spreading Covid is insane and is tyrranical. 

### 🇺🇸 Cesar P.
Fight for your freedom and your rights may God continue to cover and protect you. GOD, LOVE & UNITY are the answer not COMMUNISM

### 🇺🇸 John H.
Canadians  Protests   YES it is time.<br /><br />This isn't about Covid - it is about rule by the wealthy, vs ordinary people and our basic rights to live, work and die - as human beings.<br /><br />To  with your rules, fines, codes, fees, licenses and regulations.

### 🇨🇦 Arthur M.
I’m disgusted that I, as well as most Canadians, allowed the government to take so much control of our lives during the pandemic, because the science pointed that way, and we believed our government wouldn’t abuse these infringements on our rights.  But now that the science is pointing in a different direction, and we are trying to hold them accountable, we are racist, and an occupation force

As a German I am also threatened by my own tyrannical government with vaccine mandates, I do believe, that we, the (worldwide) people need to make a stand for freedom against forced vaccinations, for nature (and the immune system) against the  belief, that you can only save your health with Big Pharma and especially for the god given right to decide about your own body.<br /><br />

Principles are not extra frills that can be discarded when trouble starts, they are the formula for confronting problems or avoiding them entirely.   Demand your freedom and show respect for the rights of others.

Been watching this unfold since the start. To call this terrorism is insane, and the most authoritarian move since calling January 6 an insurrection. Freedom loving people in this hemisphere need to band together before all our rights are lost. Keep it up!

Help end the globalist totalitarian agenda of genetically-modified transhumans monitored through digital IDs and microchips. Medical fascism is the last step toward total control.

Went home from Texas to Manitoba in September 2021. Was surprised how restricted personal freedom and choice had become. Fear of the virus has moved people to yield their personal freedom. Those that did not agree were left with no recourse. Texas has preserved freedom and personal choice over vaccines and masks. Proud of all you Texanadians!! Keep up the peaceful protests. You have our support!!

### 🇺🇸 Maria S.

### 🇨🇦 Treena H.
Mandates were created last year to increase vaccine uptake, as were restrictions placed on access to gyms, restaurants etc. only for the vaccinated. There is a core group in every country that choose no vaccine. I do not support get-the-jab-or-lose-your-job. It's not morally right and at this point, has no utility!

Trudeau, the blackface-wearing hypocrite calling anyone who disagrees with him a  is an attack on all decent people.  Thank you to the truckers for standing up against his malice and that of so many in the establishment.
