Thank you Canadian truck drivers for taking a stand in support of the liberties of ALL Canadians, even those who criticize your protest. Once you relinquish your rights and freedoms, you stand to never get them back. Vaccine mandates infringe on these rights. No government has the right to dictate what we put in our bodies.

I was terminated from my remote job, I can't go to a restaurant, movie theatre, or gym. I can't domestically travel, and I can't attend university. The government and public health officials  have taken away my ability to pursue happiness or engage meaningfully with society... all because I want to maintain medical autonomy.<br />This needs to end now. This our chance Canadians.<br />Freedom for ALL.

### 🇨🇦 Bruce C.
It might be helpful if you could also take donations in Canadian dollars. I'm so proud of our Canadian truckers for initiating what has turned out to be a mass movement in support of individual rights and freedom.

This "Fridge minority" made the 2nd largest GoFundMe in Canadian History...until the Government intervened to cancel it. I'm a person of modest means, I wasn't sure I could afford to donate.

I’m giving double this time just because of what happened with the previous fundraiser. Don’t let up, keep up the fight until the goal is reached. I think everyone that donated previously should join in class action lawsuit to get interest on the money that they held for several weeks before canceling it, that would not only cost them a lot but would be a logistical nightmare for them.
