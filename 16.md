### 🇺🇸 GF C.
The role that these truckers are playing is part of one of the greatest modern events for human freedom. For it to be Canadian's initiating this is surprising, but they're doing a great job and receiving worldwide support. This donation is the best I can do to help at this time. The group of dedicated truckers will be remembered as heroes, greater than Kyle Rittenhouse or even George Floyd!

“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own"

We must stop globalism.   Just yesterday I talked to a relative who WAS a die hard vaccine lover.  His life has changed since he took the 2nd shot and now he has realized he was 100% wrong about the vaccine.  He, his wife and their neighbors are in a living  since they took the 2nd shot.  They are sick all the time with a cold after another and have NO energy to live life.

Many of us here in Canada, and especially us living in the province of Quebec have had enough of illegal, overbearing and ridiculous mandates. Individual rights and liberties are of utmost importance and they are essential in a country that considers itself a free one. Draconian measures are an insult and cause larger emergencies than the virus. It is time to stop ruining the future of our nation.

I travel across the border frequently and the rules imposed on cross border travelers and Canadians in everyday life are very extreme. It has been several years of this and everyone is sick and tired of it. This is not how a free country is supposed to work!
