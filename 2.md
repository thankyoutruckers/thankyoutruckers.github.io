I personally believe the quackscenes are causing myocarditis, pericarditis, seizures, paralysis, miscarriages, stillbirths,  a wide range of other symptoms, and even death. I believe those who have taken the quackscenes shed and spread to others.  It is my opinion that those responsible for the quackscenes, quackscene passports, and other mandates should be arrested and tried for their crimes.

Please consider giving the trucker's name and email for direct deposit as I believe this will be shut down again. We could donate that way - post on facegroup maybe. already I can hardly read this site and it was hard to find and it isn't working well. <br /><br />I don't the powers behind this site are happy with you and the truckers

### 🇨🇦 Trevor W.
Didn't donate to the gofundme. But here I am with an extra tip to givesendgo. All I want is freedom. I complied for 2 years but it's broken promise after broken promise from government. <br /><br />Thank you givesendgo & most importantly thank you fellow Canadians for peacefully exercising your freedom as government and media smears you as they do everything to crush regular hard working people.

I'm for freedom, against corruption of our politicians, and the genocide they are rolling out as puppets of Klaus Schwab's Great Reset.<br />We need to unite ALL against this war against Humanity and make sure that we don't forget to punish the corporations, institutions, and people who have collaborated to destroy Humanity and the world...

### 🇨🇦 Michael R.
Lets make Gofundme regret ever freezing that money.  So many people I know don't understand still.  They won't wake up, they're fine flashing their QR code wherever they go.  But they know about the truckers, some support you, some believe the lies, and others are ambivalent. But keep strong.  For all of us.

### 🇨🇦 Radka K.

Thank you truckers and everyone else standing up for Canadian freedoms!<br />As for gofundme, I will never again support any of their programs and urge everyone else to boycott them - they have made slanderous and unsubstantiated accusations against the Freedom  Convoy, probably bought off by the communist government and media.

Honkopalypse Now!

### 🇨🇦 Robert C.
Just when you think our government can't get any more dictatorial, they fabricate slanderous accusations against the Freedom Convoy to try to cover up their deceit and "scientific" corruption.  This donation is more than I originally attempted to give, because our freedom and life as we once knew it is at stake.

### 🇨🇦 Francois G.
Double my initial GofundMe contribution

Gofundme has caved to political pressure and betrayed the trust of tens of thousands of Canadians and other supporters of the Freedom Rally. They have destroyed their credibility. I for one will never support any fundraiser on their platform.<br />Thank you Givesendgo for stepping up in this stand for God given rights and freedoms!

Thank you for defending our freedom and fighting to end this insanity

### 🇬🇧 Diane D.
As an act of contrition for my hateful, hurtful, untruthful and downright despicable comments about the truckers and the Freedom Convoy, I am making a small donation to their cause. I have come to realise that President Liedeau should not be the only one to be able to disrupt everyone's lives "for the greater good" - power belongs to the people. Please forgive me.

Keep it up, we're all behind you. The police chief's threats are just bluster and easy evidence for when his personal trial comes up through the Nuremberg II trials. Don't fear his darkness, nor the snake politicians. The people have the power, and that power lies with you.
