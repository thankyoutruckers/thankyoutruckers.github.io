I'm immunocompromised and very pro-vaccine.  However, I'm very much against the fake "Left-Wingers" in Ottawa politics and the legacy media who are truly right-wing extremist as proven by their calls for police to use force to end this peaceful demonstration.

Canadians stand behind the Freedom Covey 2022 not Trudeau Mandates. Canada’s vaccinations rates are amongst the highest in the world cause our government has forced the vaccine upon us by mandating it in the federal work force & pushing corporations to follow suit and backing them up legally by changing laws and stealing Canadian Freedom from us all.  Liberalism agenda’s!

I have always been a supporter of back the blue however I believe the time has come to defund the police and impose wide spread restrictions on how the police can be used against the people, there has been a great disparity of how the police handled the domestic terror groups antifa and blm and how they harass and steal from the Freedom convoy.

This is not a vaccine for a virus, it is a ''vaccine against unemployment''. It is not about public health, but power and control over citizens. Most people I know who got the shot, did so because they were scared of losing their job. What long term consequences can they expect for their health No one knows, there are no long term studies published. God help us. 

### 🇺🇸 Stephen S.
Only the Canadians could do this.  Their reputation for friendliness and patience contradicts the narrative of hatred and racism.

THAT'S a big part of the reason why China is causing the rest of the world so many problems today.

Thank you truckers for making this stand. Stay strong and God bless you. The communist government needs to capitulate and end the ridiculous mandates. Where is trudeau hiding, he needs to come out and step down. The Ottawa city government needs to step down also. The police need to side with the truckers and not be complicit with this illegitimate action to stop a legal peaceful protest. 

### 🇺🇸 Daniel  M.
Eat  Trudeau you black faced !

### 🇨🇦 Linda C.
Freedom is not something the government can give us, it is a God-given right that we must claim and fight to protect. A peaceful protest that acknowledges God's sovereignty cannot fail. Much love.

Can't this all to be over so I can go back to smoking marijuana and sleeping in every day, like I used to in Whistler  Everyone knows there is no way that I would be the Prime Minister of a G7 country, or even a politician, if my last name weren't Trudeau.  I'm just reading the lines they give me.  This was fun when I was popular, but it's not fun anymore. Sorry, please let this all end now...

### 🇺🇸 Arlene R.
246 years ago great patriots fought to make my country free. They bequeathed to us brilliant documents which have guided us all these years.<br />Today American Marxists are devoted to the destruction of our form of government. I am in awe of the courage of Canadian citizens who have demonstrated that freedom is still worth fighting for.<br /><br />I'll be back. Say a prayer for America as I say one for Canada.

### 🇺🇸 Chris A.
Godspeed from Texas. The world supports you!

### 🇨🇦 Michel C.
Thanks to all of you truckers ! You can do what we individual citizens cannot. It is now evident that these social life restrictions and vaccine mandates have no medical grounds and benefits. This control over our lives has primarily financial and political interests, mostly tied together. Go ahead and do not surrender until they give us back our freedom, in Canada and all over the world.

### 🇺🇸 Leila A.
WE SUPPORT YOUR CAUSE, AND THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING IN FREEDOM OF CHOICE.

### 🇨🇦 John B.
Unfit to govern in 2015. Unfit to govern now. As a 4th generation Canadian, who's ancestors fled to Canada to escape tyranny, the lies perpetrated by the Prime Minister-in-hiding of this country are contemptible.

It is breathtaking to watch peaceful patriotic Canadians standing together to promote freedom.

Look what they have been allowed to get away with for 2 years.<br /><br />These people only EAT and can only FUEL their homes and cars because of you guys.<br /><br />VR

Dear Canadian government, you all need to be executed if you backed the vaccine mandates. You are guilty of crimes against humanity and the Nuremberg Code to which your nation is a signatory. I look forward to the day you tyrants are swinging from a noose. Furthermore my name is my property and any use of my name by any agent of the Canadian government requires a $500,000 USD.
