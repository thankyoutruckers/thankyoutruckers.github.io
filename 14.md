A civilized society requires minimum governance, and Canada is amongst the most civilized. The role of government is to provide freedoms and opportunities to those they serve. It must be understood that it is the Canadian government whom serves the people of Canada. Therefore the Government of Canada must always strive to reduce it's control over Canadians. God bless those who challenge Tyranny.

### 🇨🇦 Fidel  C.
Keep standing up. These tyrants are afraid of the working class. 

### 🇳🇿 Brian S.
I am proud of you guys. Our sheepish people would never do what you are doing - at least not in any numbers to make a difference. They are cowed by our version of Trudeau and two years of solid fear  on TV.

The slimy liberals are fighting back with hate speech, removing your crowd funding program, law suits, police threats, and now buying up all the hotel rooms in Ottawa ALL with our tax $ !

I support the truckers convoy and the fact that gofundme would say that they support the government that the truckers are against. Also, the fact that they would steal peoples money and donate it to an unknown charities and the fact that the people don't know where the money would have gone. Thank the lord that the money would be going back to the people. God bless you truckers from the USA.

Hats off to everyone participating in this event. Someone has to stand up to this socialist government which is trying to install a permanent social credit scoring system using covid19 as an excuse.

Hello everyone, I am appalled at what is happening in my country, our freedoms taken away! This government, along with many worldwide governments have created a narrative of fear, isolation, and division! Where there is a risk, however great or small,  there must be choice! Not anti Vaxx for those who are vulnerable or want it, BUT must have freedom of choice! Thank you to the brave convoy!

Just because a government tries to tell you how it is going to be, it doesn’t make it so.  The only way we can be controlled is to allow it by our compliance. We each need to look at our part in this. How have we complied  How have I complied Where have I done as I’ve been told without questioning  Where have I sacrificed my freedoms for expediency, just to not make waves Earn freedom.

There is zero need for a mandate. Current vaccines do not provide immunity; vaccinated people can contract and transmit COVID19. To the governments of Canada and the U.S., spend you efforts holding china accountable, not crippling your own people. #covidfacts

I donated because these guys are standing up for the freedom and rights of all people currently living under tyranny's boot heel the world over.  Truckers (and the rest of us) all across the globe need to rally to the cause - for freedom.  Go Canadian Truckers!  Go Freedom Convoy 2022!!

### 🇺🇸 Robert W.
Given the endemic mutations these vaccine mandates make little scientific sense. Omnicron largely evades the current vaccines, and Omnicron sub-variant BA.2 evades them even more. The original Covid virus, for which these vaccines were designed, emerged in 2019. This is akin to the government mandating someone to take a flu shot from several seasons ago. It is unscientific and mindless.

### 🇺🇸 Darla G.
I was born free and I’d like to keep it that way. Canada is leading the way back to reclaiming our rights and freedoms. Much gratitude and respect.
