In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. From time to time we’ve been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern

Thank you truckers for your leadership. I pray that Americans will follow your lead, as our rights are being surrendered by public indifference. I am fully vaccinated because I am 79 years old, so it makes good sense for me to do so.

Thanks Truckers = Heros!

### 🇨🇦 Lynda T.
My contribution is for the brave truckers and the on the ground supporters fighting for Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedom.  No mandate is morally acceptable that asks a person to undertake a medical procedure they do not want for the "better good".  Asking a person to undertake a medical procedure they do not want or loose their job is "force".  This is unacceptable in a free society.

### 🇺🇸 Maria L.
Thank You Truckers for your support against the Mandate.. Nurses are grateful ❤️

So thankful for the Freedom Convoy 2022! Hold the line and remain peaceful. Canadian politicians are corrupt, from the Mayor of Ottawa all the way to the PM of Canada.
