Given Canada's already high vaccination rate and omicron's relatively benign nature, Trudeau's intransigence on vaccine mandates proves that it's not about health. Vaccine passports are the first step toward a CCP-like social credit system.  We cannot allow that to be imposed on our children.  Thank you truckers!  So proud of you!

I'll be finding the Truckers' legal fund and donating a larger amount to that. I suggest others do the same. Canada's leadership would be wise to treat the Truckers with respect, or else their relationship with the newly revived conservative American leadership will be difficult after November. How much political and economic pressure can Trudeau, Watson, and other leftists take

This a secondary donation for the purpose of posting this note.  If you donated to Freedom Convoy via GFM, check the credit amt you got back.  I made a $55 CAD/$43.27 USD via GFM, but only received a $43.00 USD credit. I opened a dispute with my CC company today, and was told they are receiving numerous calls regarding incorrect GFM credit amts.  It's not a conversion rate issue either, I checked.
