Well done, thank you for standing up to the bully. Forcing people to put a chemical in their body that could have long term repercussions for a reason that isn’t even true (the vaccine does not stop you getting and spreading covid 19) seems so unbelievable… it feels like we are living in the twilight zone. Maybe you can help the government elect  to see what any mentally healthy person can already

### 🇨🇦 Terry A.
Freedom is a fundamental right.  The Freedom Convoy is shown us that we are not free.  The Government clearly does not represent the voice and the will of all Canadians.  The Government has descended into a fascist, totalitarian state.  This has become abundantly clear to Canadians and people around the world.  Its time to stand up and demand our freedom.

### 🇺🇸 Kathy C.
So thrilled to see people standing up--we always had the power, we just had to have the strength in numbers, and now we've reached that tipping point. Enough people see what is happening and willing to act on it--the key is to stay positive, do it out of love. That is our magic bullet. Nothing else needs to be fired... from the heart. Because we know those in power have no heart. 

### 🇺🇸 David P.
God bless you guys and girls, and God bless your peaceful protest.  May you gain all you ask for and much more.

### 🇨🇦 Andrew S.
Hats off to the truckers and farmers holding a corrupt Canadian government accountable for its actions.

Trudeau doesn’t represent Canadians anymore.  He represents tyranny and being an elite’s puppet to sell his soul and country (like many other wealthy countries).  Hope they’ll be jailed.

Real Democracy = Common Sense & Common Decency with Respect for All - Not Trudeau's "selective democracy" for his friends and favorite crazies.  Real Democracy doesn't use police goons to beat up a 78 year old man for beeping his horn.  Real science is not some fraudulent "expert" opinion - it's the constant objective questioning: "Does it work - Does it make sense - Does it make things worse"

The fringe is simply the silent majority that is awakening in a woke world. Trudeau and the liberals won the last election with 32% of the popular vote (of those who actually voted.)

GoFundMe would not take my $1,200 to support the Truckers Anti Mandate movement so I'm sending $2,500 via GiveSendGo.  I am so tied of the Government fraud and manipulation of Covid for their own political gain.  Time to take a stand and push back against tyranny.  In Canada and abroad let's band together and fight back with verifiable truth

### 🇺🇸 Pamela V.

### 🇨🇦 Carmyn  S.
What works for one doesn’t work for all - that’s what’s known as a dictatorship. I will not be silenced and forced into a life where are my freedoms are stripped away. As a person of indigenous ancestry, I feel this is a repetition by malicious institutions that have gone on long enough!! We have the right to body autonomy anything being forcefully put into our body is abuse. 

### 🇨🇦 Robert M.

Thank you, truckers, for standing in the gap to restore the freedoms of our nation.  Canadians have fought in the past to secure freedom.  We have always cheered on freedom-seekers around the world; in East Berlin, Tiananmen Square, Hong Kong umbrella protests, etc.   Somehow, Canadians were blinded by tyranny at home.  Thanks for politely saying "enough".  Let's end divisive Vax mandates.

My 19 year old hockey athlete girlfriend, who is vaccinated, in perfect health, and had covid 3 weeks ago is going to be fired from her job for not getting boosted.<br /><br />She works alone at a government farm tending to horses.<br /><br />That is not "Science". It is discrimination, scapegoating, and should be sickening to everyone.<br /><br />It ceased being about "Health" and "Getting through it together" a long time ago

I am donating because I have watched as our nation has fallen into the grasp of tyrants and professional criminals (politicians).

Go truckers! Stay the course!
