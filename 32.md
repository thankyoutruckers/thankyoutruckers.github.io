### 🇺🇸 Tim P.
Trudeau and his demonic ilk are Communists/Democrats within their own nation. No different then Biden and his Un-elected Regime.  

### 🇺🇸 Joe B.
Let not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part. Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. He is not a good man who, without a protest, allows wrong to be committed in his name, and with the means which he helps to supply, because he will not trouble himself to use his mind on the subject.

We stand with the truckers convoy. The government, and media have become fascist and authoritarian. Trudeau is destroying Canada, and ignoring our constitutional and God given rights and freedoms. We will never comply with an authoritarian government or leader. Ottawa's mayor and police are behaving like bootlickers, enforcing immoral edicts on the freedom protesters. This cannot be permitted.

With all due respect, Mr. Trudeau. <br />Investigations into Americans supporting Canadians in common cause<br />USA was a response to tyranny. And for many of us this still rings as true today as when it was first penned:<br />“Land of the FREE and the home of the brave”<br />

Thank truckers who oppose tyrant dictators Biden & Trudeau and their elite government henchmen who mandate dangerous experimental jabs.

I support this peaceful protest in the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi and the American War for Independence... from my own people's colonial would-be masters.

### 🇬🇧 Ross L.
Justin Trudeau is a coward and a tyrant. He LOVES the not-so peaceful BLM protests but detests the peaceful protests of these truckers. Has he declared them domestic terrorists yet Surely, it must be coming. You've got to wonder just how much money he is receiving from Big Pharma to turn Canada into the 4th . Your body is yours, and yours alone. This little man has no right to it.
