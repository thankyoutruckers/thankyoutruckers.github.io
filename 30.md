### 🇨🇦 Brian C.
Freedom is striking a balance between individual rights vs. social responsibility and its safety, and enforced by authority.  The balance will never be perfect.  It will waver with situations and needs.  Personal responsibility and accountability are the costs we pay for individual rights. The safety of social responsibility is afforded only by how far individual rights will kneel to authority.

### 🇨🇦 Darryl C.
Go freedom fighters. Can't be there but support and love what is being done. Get em'

### 🇺🇸 Barbara L.
The Freedom Convoy is no more a terrorist group than the Trump Rally participants on January 6. These tyrannical governments are just relabeling citizens to make the narrative suit their agenda. We all must support freedom or we will all live under tyranny.

I support the Convoy for Freedom and I would JustinTrudeau to apologize to the trucking industry and to Canada as a whole for trying to us through our people by making all these insane rule.

He admits this.

I've already donated to the Freedom Convoy, but I'm donating again to spite  Trudeau and his impotent threats against American citizens. I won't be intimidated by a racist communist with delusions of adequacy.<br /><br />One non-negotiable demand of the Freedom Convoy must be the immediate removal of  Trudeau from office and a ban from him ever serving in public office again.

Thx to all the truckers standing up to bullies for our freedoms! U are heros of hope on wheels! This is the most passionate about a cause we've ever been bcuz it's awful & degrading being discriminated against & punished for personal medical choices.

The Canadian Government's threat to prosecute Americans who support freedom domestically and abroad is unacceptable, and they have encouraged me to support they use of the truckers; as I understand it, freedom of movement and to associate with others without government-mandated mask policy. The masks they insist on do not help us, and are impacting our culture and children negatively.

Mandates should have been halted the moment one person died from the experimental injection.  My vaccinated spouse to his coerced annoyance gave us all Omicron.  No vax, single, double, triple made no difference! We are capable of contending with our own 7 day cold.  It’s easy.   Gov must end these mandates now.  We love our trucker warriors and all Canadians standing behind the flag!!!

Sadly, GoFundMe has proven what they are made of: as resilient as tissue in the face of those who would take away basic human rights. I applaud GiveSendGo for carrying forward an age-old courage, that Christianity and other religions around have had to demonstrate, to calmly but firmly stand up to tyranny. Well done. I doubled what I had sent to GFM. I hope all who read this will do so as well.

A donation for freedom from the current tyrannical Canadian government. Politicians it is time to lift all COVID mandates and restrictions with immediate effect. The duplicitous nature of the information to the public is a scandal routed in corrupt governance, including their implementation which was illegal from their inception. The Canadian Citizens are protected by the Canadian Charter!

### 🇨🇦 Manuel C.
I can't thank you enough for protecting our civil liberties. You are the salt of the earth, the people who make this Country a place worth living in--and moving to. I say that as an immigrant who moved to Canada in 2006 and became a citizen in 2018. And please do not be intimidated by that cuckhold  sitting in Parliament Hill--currently in hiding who knows where. Godspeed.

Thank you Freedom Convoy 2022 & all supporters. Gratitude from the people you are protecting. Please don't stop, keep up the pressure until the tyrannical restrictions are fully cancelled not just on a promise to revoke. It might take two weeks presence to "flatten the curve" some "experts" estimate. If successful this might be avoided here in the US. Can't wait to travel to Canada someday.

The more illegal actions that incompetent corrupt officials take, the deeper they dig their hole.

The entire world is watching. And, the only people opposing you are those who've been brainwashed with illogical fear. Freedom is the ONLY option.

Nothing but respect for you men and women braving the February weather to restore freedom and hope to this country. The entire world is watching and you are steadfastly on the right side of history. I am unaware of a single historical example in which those fighting for equal treatment under the law were ever on the wrong side. Hold the line, the nation will celebrate with you in victory.

I lost an uncle fighting for freedom in France in 1944 so this is a small price for us to pay to stand with the freedom 2022 convoy

### 🇨🇦 Kenneth V.
The truckers have Sun Tzu's moral law on their side. The Police can do nothing about a legal protest that involves trucks parked in the street with truckers peacefully protesting illogical mandates that have no basis in empirical science. All the Kings horses and all the King's men can't put the genie back into the bottle again.

### 🇺🇸 Mark L.
Stay strong, Truckers and Farmers and Families in Canada. You are setting a great example to freedom-loving people throughout the world!

### 🇺🇸 Thomas G.
Don't leave until they give in.

### 🇨🇦 Gloria T.
Bravo to our current Canadian government for demonstrating its deplorable regard for our inalienable rights and freedoms.  You've really demonstrated what you're made of: lies, manipulation, callousness toward a citizenry you profess to care about. Our strong, brave truckers  are our front line warriors in the fight to protect our sovereignty as a people, and as a nation.  Lots of love to you all.

As always, those not willing to come to the table do so because of fear of being exposed.  They have neither factual evidence or science to support their narratives.  Psalm 37 vs 1-3: Do not fret because of evildoers. Be not envious toward wrongdoers. For they will wither quickly like the grass....Trust in the Lord and do good.  Thank you freedom fighters for standing up for Canada and the world.

My family and I all had covid and our natural immunity is not recognized, even though we have antibodies that are more robust than the vaccine. The v-mandates are unethical, controlling, and discriminatory. <br />The truckers are giving me so much hope for our kids’ future. Please continue to stand strong. The entire world is watching and hoping. Thank you to the entire crew!

Thank you for your courage and commitment to fight to be heard. It's abhorrent that our elected government will not recognize the concerns of fellow Canadians, and resort to name-calling. We need conversation and engagement, we need patience and understanding. Our government is none of these things. No matter how much they claim, I am not alt-right, I voted Liberal. For this I apologize. Thank you

In the UK, comparing mortality figures for under 44 year olds with the average for the years 2010 to 2019 with the figures for 2020 shows no significant difference. The 45 to 64 group isn't startlingly different.  The over 65 group show a deviation of about 35000 in April and so a case can be made for offering vaccination. But there is nothing to support mandatory vaccinations.

### 🇺🇸 John  C.
I pray Canadians wake up and see the truth about the erosion of our freedoms! It is too easy to be complacent & condemn others. Get off of mainstream media & go talk to your neighbours…..preferably a neighbour who has immigrated from an oppressed country.  These Canadians are seeing the signs & know that once we lose freedoms we won’t get them back easily.  <br />Thankyou TRUCKERS & freedom guardians.

### 🇨🇦 Bill A.
Tyrants can only rule with the consent of the people. Stand Strong. We are the tip of the spear. The world is watching and will follow our lead.

Since the Canadian Gov't is threatening to pursue US citizens for contributing to Can-Truckers, I thought I'd add my name to their list of deplorables. Hopefully, this will help with buying some fuel and keeping warm and fed. 100% behind your movement here in sunny (warm) Arizona.

GoFundMe denied my freedom of speech. GiveSendGo has restored it. Thank you deeply. So I added a contribution for you as well.  

### 🇨🇦 Rakesh T.
I sincerely hope this money reaches the peacefully protesting truckers this time. They are the only hope for me and my family out of this overreach  & tyranny, that we have put up for last two years. I am out of job & my son has not seen kids of his age, as we are recent immigrants & don't have many friends or relatives. Only thing making me sick is by staying inside, and worrying about my future.
