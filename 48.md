Truckers are heroes for bringing the dismantling of Canada by Trudeau to light. The unlawful vaccine mandates were cooked behind closed doors and not debated in the house or passed legislation, the new censoring of the internet over “unacceptable views”, the degrading of unvaccinated and the divisive hate speeches by the PM has to stop.

It's noteworthy how undemocratic the ruling liberal elites response, or actually the lack there of, was for the truckers reasonable request. Just to leave us alone to live free.  Hope this is eye opener for everyone. I'm happy that the truckers where able to rise up against tyranny. I'm also impressed how well informed some of them are. I'm planning to join you in Ottawa next week.

Movements like this are required to show people that they are not as powerless as their government would have them believe. The Canadian government's reaction to this peaceful protest has demonstrated that they are desperately afraid that Canadians will be shown that they do not have to unquestioningly obey the unreasonable commands of their government as they have done over the last two years.

The cowardly and spineless PM-in-Hiding of Canada must immediately RESIGN. He is a disgrace to this country and an international embarrassment.

That is the real "science."
