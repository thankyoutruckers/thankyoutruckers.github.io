I gave $100 to the truckers through the professional thieves at GoFundMe.  Given their fraud, I'm going to give TWICE as much to the truckers instead.  I suggest all of you in the same.

I donated here because of GoFundme first trying to steal all the donations for the Trucker Convoy then after backlash deciding to refund those that asked or reversed charges at their bank. I didn't donate to the original so this is partially in protest of GFM's dishonest actions and partially to show support for peaceful protest against government mandates.
