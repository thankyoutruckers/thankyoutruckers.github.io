Collusion between government and big tech to suppress the rights of Canadians to protest for the restoration of their rights is an affront to dignity and Western values. Every MP who does not stand in support of our working class betrays where their true loyalties lie, and it's not with Canadians.

Thank you truckers for your peaceful protest for our freedoms.  We deserve to have control of our health and bodies. Vaccines don't stop the spread, cloth masks, which are mandated, don't work.  The premise for the mandates are now falsified. Time for government to incorporate the new information available.
