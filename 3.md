Thank you for having the courage to stand against this gross overreach of authority by our Federal and Provincial Governments. It is a pressure campaign causing isolation and segregation of hard working Canadians.  It’s a violation of the rights and freedoms that form the foundation of our country.

Go Truckers! <3

### 🇨🇦 Katherine  R.
Sorry I can not give more. Keep on fighting the good fight!! May God richly bless this movement! this revolution! Certain members of my family are fooled by the mainstream (lame stream) media and we are divided because of the lies on the mainstream media channels however, some members of my church are NOT fooled and neither are some of my Toronto neighbours. Get the media on your side somehow . . 

### 🇨🇦 Benjamin G.
End these unlawful mandates in Canada and BC. Government must quite discriminating against its own people. Rom 13 - government does not get to redefine good and evil, they are to uphold what is good, or we will oppose as we are now!

### 🇨🇦 Parker H.
At Queenston Heights and Lundy's Lane<br />Our brave fathers side by side <br />For freedom's home and loved ones dear,<br />Firmly stood and nobly died.<br />And so their rights which they maintained,<br />We swear to yield them never.<br />Our watchword ever more shall be<br />The Maple Leaf Forever

### 🇨🇦 Nancy L.
We doubled our donation now! The corruption you are facing is truly waking up the world to how Canda really is operated. Empty the fund regularly so they can't repeat their absolute shocking behaviour of gofundme.  Goffundme will never get a dime out of thousands of people ever again. And when Police reports lack integrity we have a huge problem. God bless all you truckers and the supporters! .

### 🇨🇦 Vincent P.
Keep up the great work!

God bless the freedom convoy, thank you for standing up for our rights and freedoms!! If we don't stand up to this our rights mean nothing.

I support the Canadian Charter, it is the supreme law of the land and any violation is illegal and therefore not lawful.  All breaches by person, organization or government should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Persons in authority of any of the above should be held criminally responsible.

The Truckers can leave whenever they want. They have the final say. They can all unite and let their trucks not deliver the product. Then unite every weekend until their demands and the people are met. The Truckers should be making wages like the "so-called" sports stars and politicians. Let them get behind the wheel and deliver the food and EVERYDAY supplies real people need. God Bless.

### 🇨🇦 Meredith M.
Trudeau's govt has violated our Charter of Rights and Freedoms. He has scolded us for not obeying the science when it is the science that is saying mandates and lockdowns don't work.  He has sneered at blue collar Canadians and falsely painted them as racists who vandalize war memorials because he disagrees with their views. I am vaccinated and I don't support mandates. I regret voting Liberal.

### 🇨🇦 Jeremy H.
Go placidly, amidst the noise and haste...Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let not this blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. <br /><br />...be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations...keep peace in your soul.

Il est temps que la répression, l'intolérance et la discrimination cessent. Nos enfants ont vécu la majorité de leur vie consciente avec ces mesures. Je veux qu'ils aient droit à la vie à laquelle nous avons eu droit. Je veux que les jeunes adultes puissent vivre et que les personnes plus âgées puissent choisir de voir leurs proches plutôt que de mourir seules. Que l'amour remplace la peur.

Finally someone had the fortitude to say enough.<br />There is little opposition to the unbelievable erosion of freedoms under very questionable health mandates.

Lies from Ottawa will not stop us from making legal donations to support a completely peaceful protest.  Thank you truckers for being a beacon of hope and a voice for Canadians ignored by politicians who think they were born to be dictators.  It's time to freeze Trudeau's assets as he's on the run

Canadians are going to have to fight their very deep, deep psychological programming to be inoffensive. There is a time and place to make a scene and be  of. Now is that time. We’ve seen you in hockey games and know you have it in you. Let your inner Marty McSorley loose. Don’t let Canada go the way of Australia. We know that once they take your freedom, they won’t give it back voluntarily.
