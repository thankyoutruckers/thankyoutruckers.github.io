I won't be discouraged by the corrupt and oppressive government and media, or the miniscule and angry 'anti-freedom' communist movement by my ill-informed fellow Canadians. We know freedom.

We are ALL Canadian and that means FREEDOM!

Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers are with the Canadians and in particular, the truckers, as they fight for our freedoms in their southerly neighbors as well as their own.

### 🇨🇦 Monique C.
I love you all!  I cannot wear a mask.  There are many places that treat me with friendliness and respect.   Thank you to those Canadians as well.

Again, I love you all with all my heart.

I live downtown Ottawa and have walked through the convoy at Parliament Hill many times this past week.   Pure love and unity.   Not at all what our Prime Minister is telling the rest of Canadians and the World.   I am still in shock by the words of our PM.  His words and reaction to this situation is why I decided to get behind the Freedom Convoy.   Thanks and Go Truckers Go....

In the opinion of honest scientists and honest front line healthcare workers, mask and vax mandates are illegitimate.  The ever-increasing damage done by these mandates to otherwise healthy people will not be ignored or forgotten.  The mandates are illegal and people will treat them and their perpetrators as such.

I don't know any of these truckers but I suspect that they are just fed up with having their rights; freedoms and dignity trampled by a government that has clearly overstepped its boundaries. Although I do not know them I love them and want to help. The hypocrites who wish to compare this group of  hard working patriots to hateful anarchists are just liars and frauds.
