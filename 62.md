Thank you all for what you are doing. The final goal is to eliminate world population. Until this reality is brought to the attention of people in all walks of life, this will not end.

I applaud the Canadian truckers taking a stand against government oppression, and that governments attempt to force an experimental lethal injection on their own people. This stand against tyranny knows no boundaries. This whole COVID mess is about money, and the Bible says it best in 1Tim 6:10.<br /><br />US citizens and Christians support our neighbors to the north! 

### 🇺🇸 Rebecca P.
You guys are heroes! You are changing the whole world! Thank you for saving us ALL from the fascist One World Order!

History will remember the sides we ALL take! Stay UNITED! With Love from Florida!

The 12th biblical month began at sunset on February 2nd. This is significant because it was on the thirteenth day of this month that God’s people gained the victory over oppression (Purim). Death was defeated then, and it will be defeated now. As He used Esther to save His people then, He will use truckers to save His people now. <br />#NoSuchThingAsCoincidence #ForSuchATimeAsThis #LetsGoTruckers

The Pilgrims had sought to return to the simplicity of the early church. Pilgrims believed that marriage was only between a man and a woman, being created by God for the benefit of their natural and spiritual life: procreation of children to increase Christ’s flock; and to avoid the sin of adultery.<br />P S<br />The dogs bark but the caravan rolls on.<br />

Section 7 also protects a sphere of personal autonomy involving “inherently private choices” that go to the “core of what it means to enjoy individual dignity and independence”... Where state compulsions or prohibitions affect such choices, s. 7 may be engaged... This aspect of liberty includes the right to refuse medical treatment and the right to make “reasonable medical choices” ~ Justice.GC.CA

"The measure of a society, of a just society, is not whether we stand up for people’s rights when it’s easy or popular to do so, it’s whether we recognize rights when it’s difficult, when it’s unpopular. <br />We are a society that stands up for peoples’ rights, and when governments fail to respect peoples’ rights we all end up paying" <br /><br />~ Justin Trudeau ~<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watchv=xBoIOQPdwMg<br /><br />

Enough with the mandates and passports<br />The vaccines don't even work so give us a break<br />Trudeau would resign if he had an ounce of brain, spine or dignity
