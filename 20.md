The time for government overreach is over! The government-paid-for media blatantly lies about protesters in Ottawa calling them terrorists, haters and racists. Instead the Freedom Protesters are law abiding, peace loving tax paying Canadian Citizens protesting the loss of Freedom!

Giving Governors Billions to encourage tyranny by executive order is evil. Time for Nuremburg II for Gates Fauci Trump. In Communist countries protest and decent are not allowed. Perfect example is having the police take truckers fuel away. Just freeze them out. If you don't know someone vaccine injured you are very sheltered and uninformed.

Thank you Truckers ! !  Trudeau says he is following the science but actually he is just trying to get votes from Canadians who think vaccines are necessary.   Vaccines are now proven not to prevent transmission of Covid.  So there is no health benefit to Canadians to continue the mandates.  Yet there is proven science showing risks from the vaccines. Each person must have the right to choose

I find  it strange that after 11 days of protest and all millions of people that have gathered on overpasses road sides and in Ottawa In this peaceful show of  support without masks to rid us of these mandates. That With such a deadly virus there should be people falling down dead all across Canada. I think that says it all.

Justin, this is what happens when you lose the consent of the governed.  Enough with the lies and disinformation. Enough with the slanderous and divisive rhetoric.

I am a playwright and screenwriter who defends the right to free speech. My 'Redneck Country' play series is often attacked, as people have been brain-washed into believing that the word 'Redneck' is a code word for racial bigotry and white supremacy. Nothing could be further than the truth! I stand with the truckers and all the other hard-working people of the world! Roll On!

I wish I could come to Ottawa & support you further...but you're actually fighting for that very right; for me, you and others to get on a plane, train, ferry... or go over the border.... Or go to work. Thank you so very much. Hold fast, show your strength & resilience as they try to freeze you out. I am sorry I cannot help further, but hope the love & appreciation of Canadians help keep you warm.

You are helping everyone around the world opposed to the shots (not a vaccine as they had to change the definition.) <br />I'm from the USA and if you don't win this, we lost too.  This shot could very well be "the mark of the beast" as it changes ones DNA.  Yahweh put his name on our DNA and it is not for anyone to change it. <br />One death or injury during the "trials" should have shut this shot down. <br /> 

### 🇨🇦 Mark L.
We are with you. Don't give up. You are on the right side of this.

### 🇨🇦 Cristina V.
Galations 5:1    It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.    Great verse quoted by Jacob Wells, CFO of GSG.  We Canadians rise to the occasion. Truth is spoken freedom. May God watch over our truckers, farmers, lawyers, doctors, nurses, journalists, and every single man, woman and child lifting us out of bondage. 

### 🇨🇦 Cory A B.
God bless you more in Jesus Christ Hallelujah.
