I am sick of the slandering and hypocrisy of the media and political class of this once great country. When BLM, which has real grievances, had SOME bad actors burning down cities, Trudeau kneeled with them instead of calling them violent terrorists. I am supporting this peaceful and patriotic movement because these mandates are against Canadian’s Charter rights.

Canadian truckers are setting an example for personal freedom worldwide. Here in Germany, as an unvaccinated but negatively tested person, I cannot go to any store to buy clothes or children's school supplies, except for supermarket and pharmacy. My teenagers cannot go to the cinema, to sports, to a restaurant. I cannot rent a vacation house even if it is in the middle of nowhere.

My dad drove as a long-distance truck driver and families of truckers sacrifice much to deliver the goods we easily consume. I have no doubt that if my dad was alive he would be in Canada right now.

Individuals must have the freedom to decide for themselves whether they should take a vaccine, especially where the vaccine is of limited efficacy against Omicron variant, the vaccine has not been subjected to long-term testing and where serious side effects may occur.

My daughter attended her first in-person lecture at U of Saskatchewan yesterday since March 2020.  This would most certainly not have happened without these truckers.

“In every age it has been the tyrant, the oppressor and the exploiter who has wrapped himself in the cloak of patriotism, or religion, or both to deceive and overawe the People.” <br />It's time to take back our country from the politicians and elite who believe they can take our god given rights and freedoms in the name of power and profit.

Western governments have shown their true colours. Politicians do not represent and serve the people, they work for big corporations supported by the corrupt dishonesty of the main stream media.

You are not only doing this for Canada but also for the United States. Although some in the U.S. are aware and praying for you, you are now the example to us in the fight for freedom. We unfortunately are once again that sleeping giant. I pray your example will give the U.S. the courage to wake up and stand beside you, our Canadian brothers and sisters in the fight for freedom. God bless you!

After my daughter was seriously injured by the Hepatitis B vaccine I did my research. Having a science and research background, I found that vaccine safety research is wrought with corruption.
