### 🇺🇸 Michael S.
If you originally donated through GoFuckMe, DO NOT REQUEST A REFUND!!! Dispute the charges with your donation because GoFuckMe will have to pay a fee for every dispute, likely about $10-$15 or so. If you dispute, you get the money back immediately. <br /><br />Again, DO NOT REQUEST A REFUND. DISPUTE!!! And share this message far and wide.

I am shocked at the behavior of the Canadian state subsidized media, acting in concert. They know that the handful of Third  symbols in the crowd were directed at Trudeau for being a tyrant and nothing more. Yet they all lied about it. Trudeau's association with the WEF's Klaus Schwab, who's economic theories seem to draw inspiration from pre WWII Germany, doesn't help either.

Some trust in horses, some trust in chariots, but we will trust in the name of the Lord our God.  May the mighty right hand of God Almighty fight for you.  May the hosts of the armies of heaven encompass the wicked and deliver us from those who would enslave us.  Let us stand and see the salvation of the Lord our God, for He is great and greatly to be praised.  To God be the glory!

My Last donation was $50.00.  I am now donating $100.00.  I so appreciate what the truckers are doing for all Canadians because without them we did not have a chance.  The tyranny of the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau's leadership has been a travesty for Canada.  He has destroyed the country.  He is truly evil.  If they lift the mandates we must make sure that they keep their word.  God Bless<br />

GFM has 3 chargebacks and GSG has my support. Thank you for supporting our freedoms. <br /><br />To the truckers and supporters, you have my eternal gratitude and undying love. Trudeau has messed up the globalist plan to divide us, and we are more united than EVER BEFORE. <br /><br />GFM can't stop us. CBC can't stop us. WE ARE ALREADY VICTORIOUS!! <br /><br />Honk HOOOOOOONK!

Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand

### 🇮🇹 Ognjen M.
A small price to pay for freedom!

### 🇨🇦 Sarah S.
Got a refund from GFM and donating that and more through this site instead. I hope everyone does the same! There's a bad rumour going around to not get a GFM refund but to instead chargeback from bank or credit card. This only hurts the donation fund, not GFM. They take a $15 chargeback fee from the donation/charity fund if you do this, hurting the charity not GFM! Don't fall for it!

### 🇺🇸 Stephen  E.
God bless you. Free thought, free speech.
