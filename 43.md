So proud of my fellow Canadians.  Mayor Watson does not speak for Ottawains, Premier Ford does not speak for himself, and Prime Minister Trudeau is the epitome of true evil who cares about nobody but his little entitled aelf.

Its sad that it has to come to this to have the leaders of Canada just listen and have a discourse with countless Canadians who are fed up with their basic freedoms being taken away. I support this peaceful lawful protest and hope that the government of Canada and mass media stop slandering these hard working Canadians. 

### 🇺🇸 Jeff B.
Thank you for your courage and commitment.

At this stage, irrespective of the quality of the convoy participants or their cause, I feel it has become imperative to provide a token of financial support for such bona fide acts of civil disobedience as are still being carried on, if for no other reason than to rebuke the arbitrary actions of GoFundMe and of other compromised and as-yet unaccountable tech platforms. 

### 🇺🇸 Deb S.

I live in Waterloo, Ontario. Today a peaceful demonstration was planned and the local police forbid it from happening. Also, our local politicians released statements in the MSM that the demonstration would contain hate speech. People advocating for their Freedoms peacefully is the opposite of these false claims.

Thank you Givesendgo for doing what is right. Thank you truckers for fighting for our freedom. Vaccination should be a choice, I don't have anything against people that opt to do it.

Doubling my initial donation (I’m unemployed so this is the best I can do) because GoFundMe just made me all the more motivated to shut ALL of this nonsense down. <br /><br />Stock up on food, folks.

I think the Canadian truckers are wonderful. It is so sad how the power hungry tyrants,  running governments, are trying to take away our freedoms.  I just hope our truckers in the US will do as the brave freedom-loving Canadian truckers are doing.  The truckers in the US have  to overcome the silencing attempts by corrupt medias to prevent them from organizing to protest the vaccine mandates.

Give in any amount, but I'm donating an additional $82 for the year that the The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was passed:<br />https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/<br /><br />Pass this on - let's see how many $82 donations or better yet $1982 donations can be made!<br /><br />(hit this site and see if they take it down)<br /><br />Vive le Canada!
