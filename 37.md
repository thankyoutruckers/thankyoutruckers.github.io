I have seen people treat cattle with more compassion than our Prime Minister has treated the people of Canada.  The damage his mandates have cause Canadians is not quantifiable. I love all the free thinking people out there, lets wake the rest of them up!  Stick together, be peaceful and respect every human for the infinite divine beings the are.

I am happy to see the resistance gaining momentum. The plandemic has been a socialists dream.  what better way to turn men into fearful obedient sheep. The 2020-22 version of the movie V is being made on the streets of Canada. I just wish this  started a year ago when those of us who were educated not indoctrinated, realized that the government and one world order crowd planned this.  SHAMEFUL

Freedom, to most it is an idea, an abstract thought that pertains to control. That’s not freedom. That’s Independence. Freedom is riding wild over untamed land with no notion any moment exists beyond the one you are living. Ride on truckers, ride for our freedom.

I support the truckers 100%. Americans love you guys! The main stream media is telling people lies, and there are 10X more people that want all covid  over and in the past, than people that buy into the opposing politics narrative. 

### 🇨🇦 Gregory G.
Let the truth be known. There is no pandemic. The gene therapy jab is a  shot lottery. The great reset is a trap. Democracy was made broken, to keep the sheeple in line. We actually live in a Kakistocracy. <br />So we support those who are ready to stand up to the powers that should not be.<br />Our goal, down the road, must be to make the politicians (shepherds) and their elite masters irrelevant.

We have so much respect for the courage and the sacrifices made by the truckers. You are our Hope and inspiration. My mother is 92  & her cardiologist advised against the vaccine.

Thank you very much Truckers! <br />Many Canadians are not aware of having been losing their freedom and rights for years, especially these 2 years of pandemic, people are used to the social obedience to the governments/authorities. Plus MSMs became propaganda of authorities. As a Canadian originated from mainland China, I know  freedom is precious. Support truckers, fight with them for freedom!

### 🇨🇦 Pardeep L.
They just added an additional mandate here in BC. I'm taking some of Bonnie Henry's wine fund and putting it to better use than her day-drinking. In the interim, she hopefully sobers up and starts to think clearly and actually "follow the science." <br /><br />These bureaucrats are the real virus on society.<br /><br />Honk. Honk.

### 🇨🇦 Patricia C.
Thank you Truckers! God bless you.  You have given me hope.   No  forced vaccinations,  no vaccine passports, no QR codes, no limits on our freedom to travel   or be with  family and friends.   We can get  our country back. Hold the line.

As someone who grew up in Canada, served in the CAF, and with a Brother and Sister still living there (with 7 nieces & nephews) in Ontario, I'm deeply saddened that I cannot return to my homeland.

Government only exists to represent the will of its citizenry, and when it fails to do this, it's to be replaced as quickly as possible so as to crush its self-serving tyranny, an abomination to the human spirit.

We watch your heroic efforts daily and stand with you 100%.  This must not stop until all mandates are withdrawn and Trudeau makes a public apology to Canadians and swears an oath to honour the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Alternatively, Trudeau resigns.  Period.

Wow, this is my umpteenth time donating, I just feel compelled to be a legitimate part of the celebrations after the win.

I was feeling so discouraged just before the truckers started their convoy to Ottawa. I have never been able to proudly say that I'm a Canadian. I struggled so much through the pandemic; losing my job, not being able to attend anything, not being able to see my SO in USA, being assaulted in public. I had lost hope, and this convoy gave me hope again. I can finally say I'm proud to be Canadian!
