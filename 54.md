Trudeau says to follow the science, so does standing in a restaurant waiting for food to take out harm fewer people than sitting down and eating it The science does not support Trudeau’s rules. Especially when an un-vaccinated waiter/waitress can deliver the food to tables for a full 8 hours. Guess Covid doesn’t follow the science either……

Vaccines are safe and work very well. Some types of masks limit spread when warn correctly. Lockdowns are minimally effective too. Effectiveness doesn't justify tyranny. For generations we risked millions of lives to buy every inch of freedom. It is wrong to sacrifice miles of freedom to save a few lives. It's an insult to everyone who has bled for freedom. Keep it peaceful or I'll want a refund!

The truckers stand for freedom that we have lost<br />in democratic countries that used to stand against communism and fascism.<br />They should have food and fuel. They delivered essentials when everyone was locked down during the pandemic.<br />Along with police, service people, doctors, nurses, ems,  fire, small business and all workers who sacrificed during the pandemic, all people should support them.

I'm fully vaccinated + booster and I think everyone should be.  I don't agree with people who aren't getting vaccinated but it should be their choice.  Government and private business should not be able to force a medical proceedure on people.  This is a slippery  and the next thing might be something I don't agree with either.
