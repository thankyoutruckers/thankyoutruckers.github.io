### 🇨🇦 S E.
CBC has incessantly lied about Covid to unsuspecting citizens and caused much of the Covid mass psychosis to drive Trudeau's agenda. CBC is now lying about our good truckers. CBC is the enemy of the free people of Canada.  It is a parasitic operation just like the North Korean state TV.  It is shameful that tax dollars go to support this shameless mouthpiece of the Liberal party.  

### 🇨🇦 A P.

Can’t thank you enough for what you are doing. Our freedoms and human rights are being taken away and it’s time to stand together and demand them back. <br />Trudeau and his government forget who they work for.

This country's leadership has taken away too many rights of the Canadian people and legislates endlessly for bigger government. They keep lining their pockets with gold while the prospect of economic independence for the average citizen shrivels and crumbles. We deserve to put Canadians first for once, and Politicians next to last. HONK HONK Brothers and Sisters!

I didn't donate to the GoFundMe campaign & I am triple vaxxed , however listening to the blatant misrepresentation of these protests by one-sided media, and the hyprocacy of our prime minister talking about how we must give the Ottawa residents their lives back yet that is exactly what the truckers are striving for but for EVERYONE not just those in a government city, I felt compelled to support!

### 🇺🇸 Aaron G.
Truckers make North America thrive without even thinking about it.  Our economies are reliant on them.  Without truck drivers, we would have no fuel at the gas stations, no food in our grocery stores, no electronics to buy from Amazon, etc...  The least we can do is to give what we can to help support their stand against mandates.  90% of the truckers are vaccinated!

Canadian truckers represent the best spirit of Western civilization. Their courage and their love for freedom will reshape this corrupted world. Canada was once my refuge after Tiananmen Square massacre. Thirty years later, Ottawa's Parliament Hill became Canadian Tiananmen Square. But Trudeau has no chance of wining against the STRONG NORTH people! Because we will never surrender to tyranny!

Thanks so much for what the truckers doing to preserve our freedoms. This shows that we have the power not the government. Were the ones who deliver goods, work in warehouses loading freight, fixing power lines, AC, picking up people's trash etc. If we say we have had enough and aren't working anymore, everything becomes crippled. They have no choice but to listen. We have the power. Not them !!!

### 🇨🇦 Dennis M.
This is about more than just mandates. It is about human rights and freedom from Government & Medical Tyranny

### 🇺🇸 Eric K.
I may not be a Christian.  But that doesn't mean I don't know wrong from right. Here's to the Freedom Convoy's success and to gofundme's bankruptcy. In the famous words of one Captain John Paul Jones when told to surrender, "Fight, I have not yet begun to fight"

### 🇨🇦 Sandra T.
This is the largest and most consequential protest of my generation! I'd love to give more, but I lost my job in November because I refused to sacrifice my  autonomy - and I worked from home. These mandates are ONLY about authoritarianism. Thank you, heroes for taking a stand!

Many THANKS to the truckers for their work and for their peaceful protest in Canada.  The longer this goes on, the more obvious it is that key "leaders" of the government want unobstructed power and will manipulate in any way they can to maintain that, including a build of false narratives and censorship.  The government forgets that their role is to SERVE the people, not rule over them.

Inspired by our brave Canadian truckers, angered by the demonization attempts of governments and main stream medias, I am doubling my donation after GoFraudMe tried to steal the previous one. <br />Immigrated from a communist country, I know how precious Freedom is and how easy it can be taken. As a fully vaccineed person, I view this is a battle for our freedom and constitution rights. Go Truckers Go!

World "leaders" and "health" officials have become tyrants and they do not want to let go of the authoritarian power they have given themselves and our freedoms which they have stolen. We have to stop complying, en masse. Peaceful non-compliance across the board.

I am a REAL Trudeau in the United States. We, the real Trudeaus, despise the PM for all the damage he has done to Canada and the West.

### 🇯🇵 Christopher S.
Like many Canadians I took the vaccine for the Delta variant. The situation has changed, and so must the approach to it. There are now FDA approved tests that give results in 15-minutes and the government should be exploring this option rather than mandates.<br /><br />Thank you for being the voice of many.

Very proud to share a continent with my Canadian brothers and sisters. Never thought I'd say that, but anyone born of freedom is my kin.

They told us BLM/Antifa were “peacefully” protesting as they looted/burned down cities. They told us cops were racist and bad. Now they’re calling this convoy an act of racism/terrorism and are using cops to stop it! WTH!<br /><br />I lost my job yesterday so I do not have much to give, but once I heard someone threaten to come after those who helped fund this campaign I decided to give what I could.

### 🇨🇦 Megan B.
Keep up the great work, ignore the mainstream media. This is a Canadian issue of having a government that isn't working right now, and can't accept new information. The same information that other countries are realising means reducing restrictions and dropping any vaccine requirements. Push for a non-confidence vote, change the government, and open Canada eyes!

### 🇨🇿 Oldrich F.
Canadians are fighting for the freedom of the entire world from tyranny of the WEF bilionairs: The Corona Committee led by attorneys Reiner Fuellmich and Viviane Fisher have conducted tens of interviews with all kind of experts and they have come to the conclusion that what has happened for 2 years was a plan very well prepared by WEF to put the whole world population in slavery

I didn’t donate to the original Gofundme because it seemed like they had raised a good amount of money by the time I caught on. After seeing how the corrupt Canadian Government and Gofundme tried to portray the Truckers as racists and steal their money I decided I’d donate here.
