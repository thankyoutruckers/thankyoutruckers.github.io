Israeli Mossad assets Blackrock & Vanguard Corp are the oligarchies that own Canada & USA's sovereignty and control Trudeau. Actually they own all the world's assets of consequence except in Russia & China. A lot of countries in the world have dictators or authoritarians, because that is the only way for a nation to protect itself from the Israeli oligarchy & it's Federal Reserve banking system.

I'm fully-vaxxed; so are most friends and family. But I firmly believe in each person's right to make such decisions for him or herself. Trudeau is a pathetic coward, as are those trying to smear the truckers and supporters as extremists. Shame on Ottawa cops! Shame on GoFundMe! I tried to donate $200 through their site but am proud to now give more through GiveSendGo. God bless these truckers!

God bless you for rising up against the vicious attacks on the human right to informed consent, & for calling for an end to all of the tyrannical govt. mandates.

Schwab & B.Gates.

Ottawa's corporatist masters have shown their hateful, fascist colors yet again. They confuse medical decisions made under illegal coercion with a mandate of Heaven, and imagine the crowd supports them when, in fact, as for all other tyrants the people are seething for their blood. <br /><br />End your lawlessness now, while peace is possible!
