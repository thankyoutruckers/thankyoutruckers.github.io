I stand for CONSENT without COERCION.

Love doesn't brag, is not proud, doesn't behave itself inappropriately, doesn't seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil; doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br />

To our Canadian Friends:  Thank you for your courage and resolve.  Trudeau invited this protest.  He is arrogant, cavalier and lacks empathy for his fellow citizens.

I'm against ALL fiat mandates enacted upon the presumption (and false continuation) of an 'emergency' that overstep the boundaries of our liberties outlined in Canadians' Charter of Rights and Freedoms, by our authoritarian governments (provincial and federal). I do not believe the government has acted according to our law, demonstrating reason or responsibility in managing this pandemic.

Justin "i squat when i " Trudeau can  it. i donated from the states and there is nothing he can do about it. I drove a truck for 20 years and support the drivers that followed after me in the<br />unjust totalitarian actions and rules should never be allowed. they did not do anything with other "social justice" protests that destroyed things in the states. they ran cover and puff piece stories.

I already donated on GoFundMe. I also already donated on GiveSendGo but I'm donating again because of the evil that's up against this movement.<br /><br />May no weapon formed against our truckers, prosper. Lord, give them clarity, patience, courage, strength to carry on, and energize them so they can achieve their goal. <br /><br />I am confident everything will be supplied for these men and women.<br /><br />
