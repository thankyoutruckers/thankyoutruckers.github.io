Thanks for being a reliable and honest platform to give funds unlike GoFundMe.

As a follower of Christ Jesus I strongly support the freedom to choose for all people everywhere. The evil in this world wants to enslave humans to their evil agenda. Strongly supporting this anti mandate movement. We are the majority in the world. May God bless and protect all the freedom fighters and expose and destroy those who work for evil, anti God movements. Jesus is LORD of all 

### 🇬🇧 David M.
Good luck.  Remember that getting rid of mandates and/or Trudeau is just the start - they will be coming for you.<br /><br />Watch for legislation making individual ownership of trucks illegal, or mandatory fittment of spy boxes which track vehicle movements and allow for remote shutdowns.

### 🇨🇦 Maxime V.
Trudeau is slowly but surely instauring socialism, communist and totalitarianism. Truckers need to be supported to save us all from that. We must stand our ground in Ottawa before it is too late. If we don't stand together against this, we'll have no other choice but to flee in other countries to take cover from these abusive measures. Doing so, families will be torn apart even more. Stand united

My wife and I cannot be in Ottawa now with the Truckers Freedom Convoy but can donate to this just cause. It is also to honour the 600 Chinese-Canadians (local born, like my late father) who volunteered during World War 2 to uphold the freedoms we all enjoy today.  It is not how long you have been in Canada, but what are you doing to better the country now!

Freedom is never without a price.  Governments today think they themselves know best what is right for both the Canadian and American people.  Both countries have histories of throwing off the yoke of tyranny regardless of what shape or form it takes.  We have votes and we have currency to make our voices heard.  We will utilize both tools for freedom.

In the words of Mark Twain: "In the beginning of a change, the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot". Our Truckers are todays patriots. Ben Franklin's Quote: "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."

Mandates and vax passports are illogical and unethical as the vaccines were never scientifically shown to reduce transmission or infection (WHO, FDA, ETC). Data worldwide now confirms they have no effect on transmission or infection. <br />This is  Politics over Health.

Making my 2nd donation.  The Ottawa mayor is "disturbed" by the sight of small children playing and laughing in bouncy castles, and has mobilized the Ottawa police department - riot squads and rooftop snipers included - to make arrests and to seize the fuel supplies of the truckers.  They want to freeze our brave brothers and sisters to death.  <br />We will not back down.  The whole world is watching.

I support the right to peacefully speak out against government overreach. Since my father risked his life for our freedoms in World War II,  I think it's a disgrace for our government in Ottawa not only to refuse to listen to the legitimate concerns of these Canadians but more so, to falsely portray this protest as violent because of their lack of meaningful  intelligent leadership.<br />

“Tyranny, like , is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated”

Our 4th donation. FYI I did an etransfer to the address Tamara posted.  CIBC bank arbitrarily  reversed the transfer cancelled it and then close down access to my account. I called this morning to find out why I no longer had access to my accounts and they told me specifically they thought there could possibly be fraud on the E transfer I made. Has anyone else had this experience

Sept 2020 my mom (Gail) was dying of isolation in Long Term Care. She was refusing to eat and was put in 10 days of isolation bc she wouldn't hold still for an invasive COVID test.

This convoy carries on the torch from all the men and women who fought and died, or endured, World Wars I and II, and any other righteously fought conflict.  You also represent the desires for freedom, truth, peace and dignity of millions who stand behind you from afar.  After the mandates go, we must reform government from top to bottom.  Thank you for being our heroes!  Never stop!  Godspeed!

I've been vaccinated but the vaccines do not work as advertised, and I have since had Omicron.  The mandates for masks, which do not work, and vaccine passports, and especially the mandates for crossing the border, transgress Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  God Bless Brian Peckford, only living signer of the Charter, and thank-you truckers, for pushing back against our enslavement.

### 🇨🇦 Joan S.
Merci à vous tous les camionneurs de vous être sacrifiés pour la cause.  Éternellement reconnaissante. Et chapeau aux organisateurs, que Dieu vous garde.

### 🇨🇦 Trevor S.
Canada is behind you. Thank you!

### 🇺🇸 Laura P.
 autonomy is a UNIVERSAL HUMAN RIGHT. No one should be able to inject you with anything against your will, regardless of intent. And yes, punishing people by stripping them of their jobs and public privileges until they submit to you is still tyranny.  Good luck to the convoy protesters, the world is with you.

Canadians have the right to dominion over their bodies. Although I am not an Anti-vaxer, I support the rights of individuals against political infringement. We should all ask ourselves what we have collectively lost, and more importantly, the values that still govern our morality. I support the truckers and all who have endured, and suffered, at the hands of abhorrent political ineptitudes.
