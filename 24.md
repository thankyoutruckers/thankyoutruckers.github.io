I think the government will back down if this latest push to starve you of food and fuel fails.  They will likely scrap the vax mandate and claim that new data suggests it's no longer required. Nothing to do with the protest, of course.<br />I was prompted to donate after reading what happened to your previous fund raiser. You could say GFM sent me. Anyway, best of luck.

Our soldiers have already DIED for our freedom.  It is settled.  In Canada, freedom must reign.

Be assured of this Mr. Trudeau: we will not surrender our freedom to you on account of COVID or any other fear-filled tactic you may employ next.

### 🇨🇦 James C.
I'm honoured to be able to support these brave men and women who are standing up for the rights of all Canadians. Failure is not an option in the face of globalist medical tyranny. We must stand together and save our nation for our children and our future. God bless them all and give them strength in the days ahead.

Love and Aloha from Hawaii! Mahalo for standing up for freedom loving people everywhere. Stay strong. Keep the faith.

Government officials should get on the right side of this, even if Trudeau doesn't.  The truckers are law-abiding citizens. I trust our court system.  Canada is a free country, and I am proud  to stand up for and support our basic rights under the Constitution.  THE TRUTH WILL OUT.  The extent of    legacy media's egregious lies to aid and abet the government's abuse of power is staggering.

These people are heroes. The tyrant is Justin Trudeau, usurping the rights of Canadian citizens while hiding. History will view him as a coward, along with Gerald Butts and Christia Freeland. I love Canada and Canadians. Long live this country as a non-post-nationalist entity.

### 🇨🇦 DONALD L.

Love you guys! Hold the line. The Canadian government and the Canadian police have been engaged in committing unconstitutional and illegal acts over the past two years. Lots of people are dying because of that. Other govs are doing the same, of course. They are next.

So pleased to donate again.   Joined tiny convoy in North Wales Saturday - every little helps!  Keep up amazing work! Reminds me of  the protest song lauded in Australia by Kev Carmody and Paul Kelly about Aboriginal land rights <br />https://www.google.com/searchgs_ssp=eJzj4tFP1zcsNjAtSs41qjJg9FJKK8rPVcjJLCnJSVUoycjMSy9WSMpMhzHTi_LLAaFpEV0&q=from+little+things+big+things+grow&rlz=1C9BKJA_enGB9

### 🇺🇸 Levi P.
Wasn't going to donate but saw that Trudeau and his Communist followers vowed to prosecute those from America who choose to donate. So I decided to donate to prove that he is powerless. We in America are stubbornly defiant of our own government, let alone a government who still swears allegiance to the British Crown. REMOVE TRUDEAU CASTRO!

### 🇺🇸 Rebecca E.
Thank you Truckers!  Stay strong & peaceful!  You are the heroes of the world right now!  <br />-love & support from Minnesota

### 🇨🇦 Scott N.
Cheers gentlemen! People need to understand that only the truckers have the leverage to stop the insanity and stand up for the rights of everyone else. Glad your fundraiser is back up. FJT & FGFM<br />  Lots of support here in Edmonton... I saw 99% positive responses on the weekend to our own little blockade of downtown. We will grind everything to a halt so they understand who works for who.<br />

This is a reply to Councillor Dean. Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;[ it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. --- Freedom is sacred, God Bless your movement

### 🇨🇦 Susan T.
This donation is because of my "tin foil hat" belief that we have Constitutional rights in Canada.    I am another "fringe minority extremist" who knows that legacy media is blacking out truth from Canadians in order to portray a peaceful, loving, caring protest as  "violent", misogynist"  "racist" in order to knowingly incites hatred.

Truckers keep the world moving by giving up their freedom to sit in a seat and deal with idiots with driver's licenses. We should be thanking them every day!!! Canada's Prime Minister is a child without real-world experience. Here's my money ... let me know if you need more.
