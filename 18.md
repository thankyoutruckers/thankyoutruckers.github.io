Mr. Smashville supports the defense of our God-given freedoms and liberties. It is obvious that Trudeau and his liberal government are pure and unadulterated fascists.

I oppose GiveSendGo comment Campaign owners have the ability to delete derogatory comments. For FREEDOM to work you must lay good and bad out for all to see -HONESTY- let individuals make up their own minds. Otherwise you end with Censorship. Truckers/supporters I say congrats/bravo for your bravery. Stay within the letter of the law to prevent them from setting you up as they did on Jan 6.

Thank you truckers for fighting for freedom for all Canadians - whether they realize it or not.  It's cold.  Not everyone in Ottawa welcomes you.

As one of Trudeau's 90% vaccinated, I am in that group against my religion and forced against my choice. Having to choose to put food on the table for my family or starve. Trudeau thinks the vaccination status of someone equals support for him, but that could not be further from the truth. Human beings should have a choice to what goes into their bodies. Simple. Keep up the fight!!

It is amazing to see the lengths to which the communist fascist elements amongst us will go to continue their agenda to enslave us via this plandemic.

I initially didn't give this protest any thought. I figured it would just be some people casing a nuisance for a couple of days, but after learning of the government pressuring gofundme to prevent funds from reaching you and now seizing supplies and goods meant for you, you have my attention and support. These acts are explicitly anti-liberal and set a terrible precedent for protesting in Canada.

The level of corruption in Canada is shocking from the Trudeau bought off; media, police and politicians. Over 1500+ media outlets that include; newspapers, tv stations, and magazines have been bought out to the tune of over 2.2 BILLION dollars to spew their propaganda of lies, hate and division. Now the corrupt local government made it illegal for protestors to bring in gas, food and supplies...

Our freedoms and rights under the constitution have been impugned long enough. It's ridiculous. Noone should be discriminated against based on medical choice. There's also safe, cheap and effective treatments. We know what's going on. Forced or coerced injections are a violation of the Nuremberg Codes. Massive numbers of people demand these unconstitutional mandates and restrictions be lifted.
