This is more than just a rally against vaccine mandates. This is a message to our Gov't, citizens of this great country of ours, and the rest of the world, that if you advocate unity, inclusivity, social and ethical principles of freedom, then ensure those privileges and rights are made available to each and every person. Time to end the hate and discrimination being promoted by our own PM.

Hooray for you, standing up to the tyrannical authority exhibited by your government. Police who are arresting fuel providers at the behest of Ottawa’s mayor who is taking his cues from Trudeau, must examine their own hearts. Ask them to stand up and refuse to subjugate you who are fighting for freedom for all Canadians. When they join you, a powerful repudiation will have been delivered.

Trudeau and all the other 'reset' marxists need to get on the right side of history.  If you watch movies like "1984" with John Hurt, and the original movie "Fahrenheit 451", you see just how governments and their media lapdogs try to shape the perceptions of their populace.  This is happening in real time with Trudeau and others making up, from thin air, stories to demonize these truckers.

Consolidate your leadership. Let that cream rise to the top. " Those who would be greatest among you shall be servant of all". Bring in experts to match the sophistication of your opposition. The establishment's monopoly will treat you as a rag tag disorganized group of sincere, but "dumb " truckers with a limited cause. So FOOL them.<br />YOU GO GUYS & GALS!<br />

Dear CSIS Glow In the Darks,<br /><br />   Make all the threats you want about funding a peaceful protest. We all know this is political motivated by Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino and the larger extent the Trudeau Administration. I refuse to be intimidated. The desire by Trudeau administrations and your organization for the truckers to freeze to death or leave is reminiscent of the NKVD and KGB.

Growing up in a Dutch Reformed Calvinist immigrant home in Canada, we learned hard work, honesty and integrity with all godliness where THE WORD was front and center. <br /><br />It seems Canadian culture has become slothful, deceitful and godless where “the self” has become god and evil is good and good is now considered evil—woe to us. May God yet show mercy to this wicked and perverse generation

I like many others are fed up with the tyranny from our governments of all levels. They don't represent me or my family anymore. If I was a journalist I would bury my head in shame for what you portray on MSM TV. Fake news, I don't know what else to call it. And the police, saying "I am just doing my job" is not good enough of an excuse anymore. Take a stand. Your a shame on the uniform

I don't have confidence in how most media is portraying this protest. I personally do not believe it is correct to implement mandates for covid19. In turn, I am supporting those taking a stand for what they believe in their hearts. I voted for Trudeau in his first campaign, but now never again. My donation inspiration: Mr. Carney. WE WILL NEVER ACCEPT YOUR MANDATES, so please stop. Love to all.

My $75 to GoFundMe was rejected, so I've doubled-down with $150. If we all double-up, we'll hit 20 million.<br /><br />The forced vax left me with permanent (so far 8 months) neurological damage. The jab don't work- 'vaxxed' still get/spread COVID, end up in the hospitals on ventilators or in the funeral parlour. Trudeau wants to force pain and suffering upon people and blame 'unvaxxed' truckers. <br /><br />Freedom!

Trudeau screams about an 'insurrection' while he send Ottawa police to steal gas from peaceful truckers.  This is behavior I'd expect from the Chinese Communist Party, not from supposedly free Canada.<br /><br />End the mandates!  Then we can all go home.  No sooner.

The Canadian government has been taken over by foreign entities. The World Economic Forum leader, Klaus Schwab, was openly bragging in a recently circulated video that he holds enormous influence over Trudeau and more than 50% of the Liberal Cabinet. The threat is real. This is why we need to fight!<br /><br />HONK HONK!!

One type of protesters burn down buildings and are called peaceful protesters by the media and government, another type of protesters are overall peaceful and then are called violent by the media and government. Canadian trucker protesters are showing the world the right way to protest, and the world is following. Well done Canada!

I also donated to the JCCF. <br /><br />We are all in this together. You gave Canada hope after two years of pain, lies, and suppression of our rights and freedoms. We now must show papers just to enter a restaurant or a store. We have had curfews placed upon us, while our leaders flaunt the rules they put upon us. <br /><br />Let's return to the Canada that is a beacon of freedom and liberty, rather than fear.

### 🇨🇦 Sophie C.
Thank you for your support of democracy and good government.  The continued emergency powers by governments to push through a maze of ever changing arbitrary regulations is crippling the world economy, setting back children's education and violating human rights.  Anyone who asks questions is treated like a criminal.  The media in Canada should be ashamed of the lies they are promulgating.

This is for that frail old man I saw manhandled February 7th in Ottawa...As I watched the angry police disregard his age and hurt him by making him put his arms behind his back--- he started falling over because his stiff old arms wouldn't bend that way -- but they forced him, and he was so frightened.  He look very, very small, I don't know if he was even 5 feet tall.  I'm still crying.
