Many in the US are inspired by your courage and actions. Two years into the pandemic we know without a doubt that these measures have no use. Canadian politicians need to look at new developments in Denmark where they eliminated all Covid restrictions..#standstrongcanada

Love you Canadian SAVAGE BEZERKERS!!! 

### 🇨🇦 Brent  L.
Was not a donor on the original gofundme but the Ottawa government and police departments pushing for the funding to be held back from the convoy has me very very concerned.  We are in very dangerous position if governments are using all means possible to shut down dissenting voices.  This current government is fine with protests that cause public unrest as long as they agree with the message.

Early treatment by ethical doctors is 100% SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. It is estimated that vaccines have killed half a million. Guess which one is approved and shilled by our government. No excuse for permitting it to be sold, or administered. Forcing or coercing people to take it is genocide.
