I was in college in 1973, at a trying time in American history, when Canadian broadcaster Gordon Sinclair released his editorial “The Americans.” He reminded us all of how again and again America had come to the rescue of countries all around the world.

### 🇨🇦 Richard L.
If you can, add an extra 10 to 20% from what you'd originally given through GoFraudMe, just to help the truckers that extra little bit since GoFraudMe is so disgustingly corrupt and trying to defraud and harm them.<br /><br />Freedoms once relinquished are very difficult to get back, if ever, so we need to fight for ourselves to not only keep the ones we still have, but also to regain those recently lost.

Sleepover in the Jetta at the Milk River barricade. It was like a huge block party. Flags, signs, fires to warm up by, potties, dance party...so many people and vehicles.
