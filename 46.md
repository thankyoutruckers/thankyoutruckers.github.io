The people have a legal right to work, to earn a living, to run their businesses. It is EXPECTED AND NORMAL that hospitals will never be able to accommodate sudden surges in demand.

The Canada I am living in during COVID is not the Canada I grew up in. Canada used to set the standard for the rest of the world of what a free country really looks like. <br /><br />Since COVID the establishment politicians have stolen away our most fundamental freedoms and turned Canada into a quasi police state. This had to end and that is why I am supporting the truckers. 

### 🇺🇸 Amy B.
 Go Canadian truckers!   Thank you for standing up for freedom!   I hope your bravery rubs off on the American truckers and they do the same here in the USA.  The whole world is watching you.  Don’t give in!   We need you to save us all from this tyranny!  Thank you and may God bless you all and keep you safe.

Thanks to all of you for taking a stand.  My generation stood against the tyranny of the war in Vietnam.  Maybe you don't see the connection, but Covid is only a distraction.  The objective of world's elite is to subjugate the 'unwashed'...to control the masses.  The 'media' instills fear and people trade freedom for the perception of safety.  History is repeating.  I know you will succeed.

Thanks for making a stand!!

### 🇺🇸 Sohaib K.
May the truth be exposed at the hands of your fringe minority. I cannot wait for the day the corrupt doctors who allowed this to continue to further their own pockets submit to the hands of people they looked down at the most - the peace loving truckers.

thanks for stepping up when GoFundMe joined the mainstream media and government in trying to prevent a peaceful protest that supports unity, community, and freedom.<br />#pierrepoilievreforpm

### 🇺🇸 Deval S.
Stay Warm, Thank you. WIth you from USA

### 🇺🇸 Lynn F.
We are all praying for you here in the United States. God Bless You!

### 🇨🇦 Daniel E.
Supporting the protest because what the government is doing - is wrong. The arrogance of both politicians are citizens here is unparalled in the history of this country. Justin and politicians need to resign.<br /><br />I had sent to GoFundMe and then they cowardly torpedoed that campaign in one of the most spineless displays I've ever seen.<br /><br />Please don't leave until they are forced to do the right thing. 

### 🇺🇸 Vicki P.
I live in the United States but I am Canadian. I am proud to be a Canadian again!!!! I pray for freedom and victory every single day!
