Our prayers are with you.  You represent many who feel voiceless in the USA.  George Washington and his rag-tag army of farmers and hard working people  defeated the Huge well armed, well funded British Army during the American revolution.  It is time once again to stand for FREEDOM.

We have varied and increasingly valuable resource wealth yet we are becoming poorer.<br /><br />Our "4th Estate" is little more than a hateful propaganda tool.<br /><br />Confederation has been ended with a SCC ruling saying there are no provincial areas not subject to control by Ottawa. <br /><br />Our Elite and political class has abandoned citizens, destroyed our Constitution, ended Rule of Law. <br /><br />Please help Freedom<br /><br />

### 🇺🇸 jean M.
thanks for being  strong

### 🇨🇦 Jonathan R.
Keep fighting for freedom. We are supporting you with rallies around the country. You played by their rules and they still lied.

This is only the beginning.<br /><br />PS: Crypto solves all these problems.

This is how you get sh*t done. These Globalist "Build Back Better" aholes are not our rulers and are definitely not gods as they wish to be.  It's not "Conspiracy Theory" it's "Conspiracy Fact" and all one has to do is look up "Build Back Better" via the United Nations&World Economic Forum.  God Bless Patriots world wide who stand against this Corporate/Political "Global" treason against us all.

The Freedom Convoy 2022 started as a truckers' border crossing issue, but now has become much, much, more. It is about Canadians' Fundamental Freedoms as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<br /><br />I think what GoFundMe did, in collaboration with the Ottawa Police and Canadian Government was despicable. Truck Yeah!

There has been a lot of talk for decades among the new age folks of “ascension”, a time when the collective vibration of humanity would increase and we would instantly transcend to a higher state of being.  <br />Apparently, the cosmic waves are a bit higher up in the True North.  <br />To those who choose freedom over fear, I salute you!  We truly already have everything we need to defeat evil.

If you donated to Go Fund Me dispute the charge and have your credit card issue them a chargeback which makes them pay a fee for taking your money. Then also fill out their refund form just in case your communist credit card company doesn’t issue the refund. If you donated a lot, take them to small claims court. Make Go Fund Me miserable.

Had Justin done his job properly, my friend would still be alive. <br />I'm tripled vaxxxed and I still support freedom of choice. <br />Where are all the "Canadians" that left other countries that left because of the "Trudeau like Tyranny"!!! Why aren't all these new" Canadians supporting a free society<br />I Don't support the "Karen"culture and people that hide their identity. <br />

### 🇨🇦 Michael T.
As a Canadian, I donated because I cannot stomach that insufferable Justin Trudeau, demanding we follow his twisted logic in almost everything he does; the man is sick ... <br />Trudeau and his  Leftist WOKE  Socialists in power that are permeating our culture, are nothing but "paper" bullies, a Cancer  that has no place in our society.... Long Live CANADA and our brothers and sisters in the USA.

Its outrageous Justin Trudeau is trying to marginalize these protests by labeling them as racists and white supremacists.  And totally unacceptable of gofundme to shut down donations.  Drop all COVID Mandates.  Support freedom

### 🇨🇦 Shane M.
Growing up in Canada, we have always considered ourselves to be burden lifters in the world, sadly because of the current government and the heavy mandates we have been crippled as a nation. Our hearts our filled with Hope that God has raised up an army of peaceful freedom fighters. We have 6 children and one is a 9 weeks old, or we would be down in Ottawa with you. Lord Bless and Keep You!
